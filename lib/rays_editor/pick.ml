(* Viewport provenance (plan W6).  Every collecting merge of a workspace tags
   its primitives with [Flow_sop.Lower.tag]; this module reads the tag back
   from the displayed geometry, casts a CPU ray to find the primitive under the
   pointer, and tints the primitives of the probed iteration.

   ponytail: a CPU ray over [Rdk.Surface_index] (a BVH of the displayed
   geometry, built at the first click and kept with the piece), not an ID
   buffer.  The upgrade path when meshes pass about 1M triangles is an OGPU
   ID-buffer feature (skill add-ogpu-feature). *)
