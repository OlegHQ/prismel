(** Immutable deterministic random generators.

    Every sampling function returns the sampled value and the next generator.
    A generator can therefore be reproduced, stored in a model, or split for
    independent multicore work without shared mutation. *)

(** Stateless uniform sample greater than or equal to zero and less than one,
    keyed by [index]. This is the
    allocation-free deterministic path for disjoint parallel element ranges;
    it does not advance or mutate the base generator. *)

val int : bound:int -> t -> int * t
(* Uniform integer in the inclusive range. *)
