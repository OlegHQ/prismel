(** Build the exact combinatorial convex hull of the selected input points.
    One unique point produces a free point, collinear inputs produce one open
    endpoint segment, coplanar inputs produce one closed convex polygon, and a
    full-dimensional input produces an outward closed triangle surface.

    Exact predicates own every affine, visibility, and horizon decision.
    Floating-point face distance is used only to choose a legal pivot from an
    already exactly classified outside set. *)
