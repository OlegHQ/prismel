(** Immutable balanced index over packed 3D points.

    Construction uses an in-place median partition, skips globally flat axes,
    and stores one packed point-index permutation plus at most three active
    axis codes. Queries are deterministic: equal distances are ordered by the
    original point index. *)

(** Build an index in expected O(n log n) time and O(n) auxiliary storage.
    Deterministic quickselect has an O(n squared) adversarial worst case.
    Non-finite selected source positions are rejected. [points] restricts the
    index to a matching point group. Disjoint tree ranges build in parallel at
    or above [grain], without changing the packed permutation. Empty
    inputs/selections are valid. *)
