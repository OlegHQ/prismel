(** Build one exact two-operand arrangement and evaluate a polygon Boolean.
    Both operands may be oriented solids or zero-volume surfaces.
    Point/vertex/primitive attributes and ordinary/native groups transfer
    through exact source ancestry; conflicting point fields are rejected or
    promoted explicitly. Standard point/vertex [N] is interpolated,
    normalized, and negated whenever extraction reverses its source facet, so
    it remains aligned with output winding. Surface subtraction emits paired
    opposite-facing cut walls. A finite non-negative tiny-seam threshold enables bounded,
    independently certified contraction batches; strict cleanup refuses to
    publish while candidates remain after the explicit batch bound.
    Independently of that optional cleanup, exact vertices that cannot be
    represented distinctly in binary64 pass through a mandatory bounded
    repair: only zero-area closed/pair-canceling subcomplexes or ULP-scale
    edges are considered, ancestry is composed through every change, and the
    complete rounded incidence/self-contact verifier remains the publication
    gate.

    [piece_attribute] optionally writes a dense, deterministic primitive
    integer attribute identifying the exact oriented Weiler cell bounded by
    each output face. Unlike split seam points, this keeps all exterior and
    cut-wall polygons of one closed fragment under one identity while allowing
    adjacent fragments to share seam points.

    Output is triangle-only by default. Detriangulation reconstructs only
    unchanged source polygons or every coplanar same-source polygon and never
    crosses an exact seam. Seam points may remain shared or be duplicated per
    incident primitive component. Closed validation defaults on only for two
    solid operands. All phases honor cancellation and stable packed ordering;
    parallel face work and payload transfer are exact across domain counts.

    [Shatter] requires two solids and emits A-only, overlap, and B-only
    boundaries in that stable order. Optional distinct primitive-group names
    identify the three products; passing [None] suppresses a group. Shared
    walls are intentionally duplicated between adjacent products.

    Broad phase is expected O((A+B) log(A+B)+C) for input triangles [A]/[B]
    and candidate contacts [C]. Exact refinement, radial assembly, payload,
    and materialization are output-sensitive in the refined arrangement size;
    the unavoidable worst case is quadratic when every source/refined AABB
    overlaps. Packed topology/ancestry and spatial indexes are linear in input
    plus refined output, excluding exact-construction limb storage. Cleanup is
    bounded by [cleanup_max_batches], with each batch linearithmic in current
    surface edges plus exact rounded verification candidates. *)

    self-intersection products. The coincident output can receive one complete
    primitive group. No approximate proximity edge is introduced. *)
