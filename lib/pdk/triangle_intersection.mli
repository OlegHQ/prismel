(** Shared allocation-free triangle/triangle narrow phase.

    The module is private to PDK. It is the single floating-point decision and
    event-generation boundary used by Boolean diagnostics and intersection
    point construction. *)

(** Write at most [max_events] unique pair-local events to [events] and return
    the count. Each event stores world position, source barycentric weights,
    and collision barycentric weights in [event_stride] consecutive floats.
    Ordinary shared-point/shared-edge contact is suppressed in self mode;
    duplicate triangles and overlap beyond a shared edge remain visible. The
    three supplied scratch arrays are worker-local and must have lengths at
    least 26, 10, and [max_events * event_stride]. *)

(** The same decision/event kernel over explicit packed point indices. This is
