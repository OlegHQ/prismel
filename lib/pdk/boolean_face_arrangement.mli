(** Insert exact T-junction and proper segment/segment intersections, using a
    TPI, line-plane, or projected line-line construction for crossings, then
    split every constraint into stable non-crossing subsegments. When supplied,
    exact coplanar overlap boundaries join the same per-face arrangement.

    Certified implicit-point intervals feed a two-axis sweep before exact
    predicates. Sparse faces take O((s + p) log (s + p) + c) broad-phase work,
    where [c] is the conservative AABB candidate count; interval-heavy faces
    retain an O(s^2 + s*p) worst case because their true arrangement can be
    quadratic. Candidate storage is capped; dense sweeps switch to a packed
    stable-index BVH that streams candidates in oracle order with O(s + p)
    index/scratch storage rather than materializing every pair. Exact initial
    point canonicalization is O(p log p); constructed events are interned in a
    packed exact-coordinate AVL index and per-segment split incidences are
    deduplicated in an integer pair set. Repeated multi-way observations reuse
    one exact event. [Stable_bvh] forces the indexed path and [Exact_oracle]
    retains the unculled quadratic traversal for differential regression and
    benchmarking; production callers use adaptive [Sweep]. *)
