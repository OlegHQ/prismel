val compile : string -> (t, string) result
(** Compile a whitespace-separated sequence of full-name glob terms. Blank and
    [*] select all names. A leading [^] excludes a term; when the first term is
    excluded, selection starts from all names, otherwise it starts empty.
    Later matching terms override earlier ones. Globs support [*], [?], byte
    classes/ranges such as [[a-z]], negated classes such as [[!0-9]], and
    backslash escaping. Malformed escapes/classes return [Error]. *)

val matches : t -> string -> bool
(** Test one name without allocation. Matching is against the complete name.
    Time is O(pattern bytes + name bytes) for ordinary globs; repeated-star
    backtracking has O(pattern bytes * name bytes) worst-case time. *)

val apply : selected:bool -> t -> string -> bool
(** Apply the compiled terms to an existing selection bit. This is useful when
    implicit names, such as attributes supplied by reference geometry, precede
    the textual pattern. Unlike {!matches}, this does not infer the initial bit
    from whether the first term is an exclusion. *)

val source : t -> string
(** Original parameter string. *)

val compile_rewrite :
  pattern:string -> replacement:string -> (rewrite, string) result
(** Compile one full-name glob and replacement. Each [*], run of [?], or run
    of character classes in the source captures its matched bytes. Replacement
    wildcards substitute captures, pairing distinctive wildcard shapes first
    and remaining captures in stable order; this permits [*_???] to become
    [old_???_*]. Source and replacement must each be one non-exclusion term
    with equal wildcard-group counts. Backslash escapes make metacharacters and
    whitespace literal. *)

val rewrite : rewrite -> string -> string option
(** Return the rewritten name, or [None] when the complete source glob does
    not match. *)

val compile_rewrite_set :
  pattern:string -> replacement:string -> (rewrite_set, string) result
(** Compile aligned whitespace-separated rename terms. Exclusion terms in the
    source selection do not consume replacements; every positive source term
    has one non-exclusion replacement term. When several source terms match,
    the last matching rename wins. *)

val rewrite_set : rewrite_set -> string -> string option
(** Apply an aligned rename set to one complete name. *)
