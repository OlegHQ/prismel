(** Promote an ordinary attribute between point, vertex, primitive, and detail
    owners. Incidence reductions use stable source order and disjoint
    destination ranges, so results are byte-identical across domain counts.

    Float scalar/tuple storage supports every scalar reduction, component by
    component.
    Integer storage supports [First], [Last], [Minimum], [Maximum], [Mode], and
    [Median] without overflow-prone implicit coercion. Text/index storage
    follows Houdini's string policy: [Average] uses upper [Median], [Sum]
    concatenates incidence-order strings without separators, the other numeric
    reductions use [First], and explicit [First]/[Last]/[Mode]/[Median] retain
    their named behavior. Mode ties choose the smallest value and an even-sized
    median chooses the upper middle value.

    [Array_all] writes every scalar integer or float match in incidence order
    to packed CSR rows. [Unique_values] writes duplicate-free values in
    ascending [Int.compare]/[Float.compare] order; floating signed zeros and
    NaNs therefore use OCaml's total-comparison equivalence. Wider floating
    tuples, text, and existing arrays return a structured unsupported-storage
    error until PDK has tuple-width and text-array representations.

    [piece_attribute] names an integer or text partition attribute owned by
    [destination]. Destination elements with equal partition values receive
    one reduction over the union of their corresponding source elements.
    Sources are deduplicated and ordered by element index before reduction, so
    first/last and all tie behavior are deterministic. Same-owner promotion is
    useful with this option. Empty incidences produce zero (or empty text).
    Canonical point position [P] is intentionally not an ordinary attribute
    and must be changed by a geometry operator.

    [index_attribute] writes the contributing source element number as a
    destination-owned integer attribute for [First], [Last], [Minimum],
    [Maximum], or [Mode]. Ties select the first stable incidence; piece
    relations are deduplicated and source-index ordered. Empty incidences write
    [-1]. Scalar sources produce an ordinary integer attribute. Float2/3/4
    sources reduce independently per component and produce a fixed-width
    packed integer CSR row containing one source index per component; this
    preserves divergent extrema/modes without inventing an ambiguous scalar.

    Ordinary reductions are O(destination elements + traversed incidence *
    tuple width). Median uses expected linear-time introspective selection with
    an O(incidences * log(max incidence)) worst-case fallback. Mode uses
    allocation-free range sorting after one packed incidence materialization;
    large dense integer ranges instead use O(incidences + value range)
    counting. Piece promotion radix-orders encoded
    piece/source pairs in O(incidences * machine-word digits), then reduces
    unique sources. Auxiliary storage is O(points + incidences + destination
    elements), including primitive-to-point reverse incidence when needed.
    [Array_all] is O(incidences) time/storage. [Unique_values] is
    O(incidences * log(max incidence)) time and O(incidences + destinations)
    auxiliary storage, plus its exact packed result. *)

    one replacement term, exclusions consume no replacement, and the last
    matching positive rule wins. Output names are preflighted and duplicate

    acts as a keep-pattern mode. When [reference] is present, its attribute
    names are implicit leading inclusions for their respective owners, so
    later exclusions such as [^name] can retain selected reference names.
    Canonical point position [P] is never ordinary metadata and is preserved.

    The operation is atomic, O(attributes + reference attributes) for a fixed
    number of pattern terms, uses O(attributes + reference attributes)
    auxiliary metadata, rebuilds the attribute table once, and structurally

    with the two legacy driver-name arguments. Polygons use Houdini's
    triangle, bilinear-quad, or polygon-fan parameterization; open and closed
    curves interpolate over their ordered segments. Numeric point/vertex
    fields are weighted, primitive/detail fields are constant, and integer or
    text fields choose the greatest-weight corner with stable local ties.
    Integer-array and float-array fields are opaque variable-length values:
    the whole CSR row at that same greatest coefficient is copied rather than
    performing element-wise arithmetic across unequal row lengths. Destination
    blend selects the new row inclusively at one half; keep/default misses
    preserve/clear the row.
    Point-weight mode accepts point/detail sources, vertex-weight mode accepts
    every owner, and primitive-weight mode accepts primitive/detail sources.
    Weighted row layouts must match exactly; source numbers and finite weights
    are validated before parallel writes. [normalize_weights] divides a row
    whose signed sum has magnitude greater than [1e-20] by that signed sum;
    negative totals therefore normalize to positive unit total while retaining
    each coefficient's algebraic contribution. A zero-sum row has zero new
    influence and preserves existing numeric, discrete, and group values. The
    absolute pre-normalization sum ramps existing/new influence linearly to
    full at [threshold]. In primitive mode, [compute_weights] atomically emits
    equivalent point- or vertex-number and weight CSR rows while preserving
    paired existing rows outside the selection.

    The four optional owner patterns expand stable source metadata into
    same-name outputs after the explicit [attributes] list; point patterns may
    include canonical [P]. With [match_groups], the point, vertex, and
    primitive patterns also select same-name source groups. Group membership
    is interpolated as a weighted 0/1 field, blended with existing destination
    membership, and thresholded inclusively at one half after destination
    blending. Duplicate destinations are
    rejected atomically.
    Standard float3 [N] is normalized before blending. Invalid primitive
    numbers follow [unmatched]; [selection] restricts destination writes.

(** Directly copy attributes between ordered source and destination element
    selections. [Cyclic] repeats the source selection in group traversal order.
    [By_values] matches point or primitive integer/text values and chooses the
    highest matching source element number. [To_element] reads source element
    numbers from an integer destination attribute and rejects numbers outside
    the source group.

    Attribute ownership is independent of [group_owner]. Corresponding group
    element pairs project through topology: point incidences, vertex owner and
    referenced point, or primitive corners. Later destination-group/local
    incidences win deterministic cross-owner conflicts. Conflict-free
    projections and every packed payload plane fill disjoint ranges in
    parallel. One projection is shared by every copied field of an owner and
    ordinary metadata is committed once. [allow_position] admits canonical
    point [P] as a source or destination; it is otherwise excluded. Expected
    work is O(group elements + projected incidence + copied payload), with one
    integer mapping per selected destination owner and exact output storage. *)

(** Transfer point attributes from a spatial source onto target points.
    [Nearest] copies from the closest source point. [Inverse_distance] and
    [Kernel] blend numeric scalar/tuple values from up to [neighbors] nearest
    points; integer and text values use the closest point. Kernel [radius]
    controls compact support independently of [max_distance]. Exact-position
    inverse-distance matches always copy the lowest-index exact source and
    cannot divide by zero; kernel modes blend equal-position samples and use a
    stable nearest fallback when their total support is zero.

    [names] selects exact names; [pattern] selects Houdini-style globs and is
    mutually exclusive with [names]. Both absent defaults to every point
    attribute in source order. Canonical [P] is excluded. [source_points] and
    [target_points] restrict indexed source
    points and written target points through matching packed groups. When no
    source lies within [max_distance], [Keep_target]
    retains an existing same-kind target value and otherwise uses the storage
    default; [Default_value] always uses the storage default.

    [max_distance] is the full-influence threshold. A positive [blend_width]
    extends the search radius and blends numeric values through [falloff];
    discrete values switch at half influence. [Uniform bias] applies its fixed
    weight only inside the blend band. Zero blend width retains the direct-copy
    hot path and allocates no influence plane.

    Equal-distance ties use source index, and each target is evaluated in a
    disjoint output slot, making results byte-identical across domain counts.
    Index construction is expected O(s log s); querying is expected
    O(t log s + t * k), with O(s + t * k + output) auxiliary storage where
    [k] is one for [Nearest] or [neighbors] for weighted transfer. Weighted
    modes allocate one normalized O(t*k) coefficient plane shared by every
    numeric payload component. Degenerate
    search distributions can visit all source points per target. *)

    primitives query their arithmetic point barycenters. Numeric point/vertex
    storage uses exact barycentric weights; primitive storage is constant over
    its triangle. Integer/text storage selects the largest barycentric corner
    with stable local-corner ties. Standard float3 [N] is normalized after
    interpolation. [distance_attribute] optionally writes closest Euclidean
    distance with [target_owner]. [source_primitives] restricts complete source
    polygons. [source_vertices] further retains triangulated regions with all
    selected source corners by default, or any selected corner with
    [Any_triangle_vertex]. Both groups may be combined. [target_elements] must
    match the destination owner and restricts writes. [target_points] is the compatibility spelling for a

    [max_distance] is a full-influence threshold. A positive [blend_width]
    extends the query radius and blends numeric values back to their existing

    Zero blend width uses direct writes and allocates no influence plane.

    Source geometry must contain finite, non-degenerate simple polygons.
    [unmatched] and [max_distance] follow {!transfer_points}. Equal-distance
    triangles select the lower source primitive and then stable internal
    triangle. Ear clipping is O(sum(c²)) for polygon corner counts [c]; BVH
    construction is O(s log s) time/O(s) storage over emitted triangles.
    Expected query time is O(t log s), with O(t + output) query-plan storage.
