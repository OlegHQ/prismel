# lib/runtime rules

## Library ownership boundaries

- `prismel` owns target-independent application semantics: `Sketch`, immutable
  `Frame` facts, pure `Scene` data, public `Event`/`Input`, resource APIs, and
  renderer behavior. It may call the narrow `runtime_next` lifecycle/presentation
  boundary, but it must not implement HTTP, WebSocket, DOM, or browser policy.
- `runtime_next` owns SDL3 subsystem lifetime, native environment setup/restoration,
  Metal surface presentation scheduling, and typed event translation. It must
  not own widgets, scene constructors, or application models.
- Sibling libraries such as `pxui` depend only on public `prismel` semantics.
  PXUI represents text-entry intent as pure `Scene` metadata; it must never
  call native runtime modules or inspect platform internals.
- Cross-library communication uses narrow typed functions. Do not expose raw
  SDL, Metal, or runtime internals in `Scene` or public sketch code.
- A boundary change must include a Dune dependency-direction check, focused
  tests at each affected boundary, and an update to `specification/backend.md`.

## Native runtime contract

- Runtime has one native Metal lifecycle: initialize SDL3 on the initial
  domain, create the high-DPI Metal view and `ogpu_metal_native` surface, translate
  events, acquire/present drawables, drain completion/deferred release, then
  destroy GPU resources before the view/window/SDL.
- Native fixed-pipeline `Scene3` meshes render through Metal with hardware
  transforms, depth/stencil, lighting, culling, blending, and window MSAA.
  Functional shaders require typed MSL/IR support or return a typed
  unsupported-feature error.
- Native GPU access and packed mesh caches belong to `prismel`, stay on the
  initial domain, submit through `ogpu_metal_native`, and remain strictly bounded
  under changing procedural meshes. Verify more than the first presented frame.
- A compatible native Metal device and surface are required. Their absence must
  return a typed startup error.
- Any automated application-loop test must arrange its own termination.
- Keep SDL3, Metal, texture, font, audio, event, and cache operations on the
  initial domain. Never create a domain or thread per frame.

## High-DPI and coordinate contract

- Treat `Sketch` configuration sizes, `Frame.width`/`height`, `Scene`
  coordinates, `Input.mouse_pos`, mouse event positions, and PXUI layout as
  logical points in one shared coordinate system.
- Keep SDL3 logical size synchronized with the actual window size.
  `SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED` is authoritative.
- Do not manually scale mouse events for Retina displays. SDL3 logical event
  coordinates keep drawing and hit testing aligned.
- Query Metal drawable size for physical backing pixels. Preserve
  `Frame.drawable_width`, `drawable_height`, `drawable_size`, and
  `pixel_scale` as the explicit native-pixel boundary.
- Convert a logical `Scene.view3d` sub-viewport to physical drawable edges
  exactly once inside the native GPU backend before configuring a Metal viewport
  or scissor. Never pass logical Retina coordinates directly to Metal.
- `Canvas.capture` and `Canvas.save_screen_png` read and preserve the full native
  framebuffer. Never allocate their readback from logical window dimensions.
- Keep `Scene.text` on an installed platform UI font and interpret `?size` in
  logical points. Font texture caches must include renderer density and
  rerasterize at native resolution. `PRISMEL_UI_FONT` remains the portable
  override; do not bundle Apple system fonts.
- Keep automatic scene text memory-bounded with the per-renderer 256-entry LRU
  without shortening the documented lifetime of explicit
  `Font.cached_text` images. Preserve empty text as a safe no-op rather than an
  SDL_ttf error.
- Keep renderer-local text caches LRU-bounded to 256 textures, including for
  rapidly changing labels, and preserve empty text as a valid no-op.
- Keep diagnostic text inside the native scene command path; do not reintroduce
  a legacy bitmap-font dependency.

High-DPI changes need coverage for renderer logical/output size, native
capture dimensions, logical mouse alignment, per-frame delta reset, and PXUI
press/drag/release behavior at simulated backing scales.
