(* Does a live resize freeze frames?

   On macOS, dragging a window edge runs AppKit's resize tracking loop inside
   the call that pumps events, so a program that renders from its own loop
   (Rays's) gets no iteration until the drag ends: the frames freeze while
   the window is being resized. SDL can call a function from inside that loop
   (an event watch), but running OCaml there is a callback into OCaml, which
   specification/sdl3.md forbids; that exception is an open decision.

   This executable measures it with a real window.

   --auto  (the default, run by @qualification): resizes the window
           programmatically and checks that frames keep coming and that the
           window's size reaches the runtime through SDL's size events, never
           by polling. A programmatic resize does not enter AppKit's tracking
           loop, so this is the control: it shows nothing freezes without the
           drag, and that the event path used after a drag is correct.

   --drag SECONDS (by hand: dune exec lib/runtime/native_qualification/runtime_live_resize.exe -- --drag 15):
           opens the window and measures the longest gap between frames while
           you drag an edge of it. A gap of 100 ms or more while you were
           dragging is the freeze; a smooth drag keeps every gap under about
           40 ms at 60 Hz. It cannot run unattended: only a pointer drag on
           the window border enters the tracking loop. *)
