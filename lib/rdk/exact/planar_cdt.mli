(** [triangle_points] and [constraint_points] are packed triples and endpoint
    pairs. [insert_points] are exact-callback point indices not yet referenced
    by the input topology; each is inserted by an exact face/edge split before
    constraint recovery. Input triangles must be a counter-clockwise manifold triangulation;
    constraints must form a non-crossing PSLG whose open segments contain no
    other input point. Missing constraint edges are recovered by tracing and
    flipping crossed diagonals, then unconstrained edges are restored to a
    deterministic constrained-Delaunay state. [flood_from_hull_boundary]
    removes triangles reachable from any unconstrained convex-hull edge
    without crossing a constrained edge. [constraint_winding] supplies signed
    directed polygon-boundary multiplicity per input segment;
    [remove_outside_constraint_polygons] retains triangles with non-zero
    propagated winding. [workspace] amortizes topology planes and the edge
    table across sequential builds while keeping each result independently
    owned. Passing the immediately preceding result by physical identity plus
    a contiguous suffix of inserted points continues its live incidence
    incrementally; every other input takes the full rebuild path. *)
