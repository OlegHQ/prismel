    primitive; a field missing on that operand receives its storage default.

(** Interpolate point/vertex payload through exact corner barycentrics. Point
    payload must agree at shared output points under [point_tolerance] or be
    explicitly promoted. The tolerance is finite, non-negative, and applies
    only to numeric agreement; discrete values and groups agree exactly.
    Fixed-width numeric storage interpolates, [N] Float3 normalizes, discrete
    storage chooses the stable dominant source corner, and equal-width
    Float-array rows interpolate componentwise. Native edge groups are unioned
    through all exact coincident-member and split-edge ancestry. *)
