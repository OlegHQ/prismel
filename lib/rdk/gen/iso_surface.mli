(** Streaming deterministic isosurface extraction into packed RDK geometry.
    O(lattice cells + emitted vertices) time; O(x*y + z + emitted vertices)
    auxiliary storage for callback fields, excluding the caller's sampled
    volume. Sampled extraction owns O(workers*x*y + z + emitted vertices)
    scratch with rotating planes per active worker. Sampling and cell
    work use the shared Parallel pool, with stable disjoint ranges and exact
    one-domain/multi-domain ordering. Grain defaults to 16,384; fewer than two
    chunks per plane/slab stay sequential for callbacks. Sampled volumes use
    stable consecutive slab chunks containing at least one grain of cells;
    fewer than two chunks retain plane/slab scheduling. Cancellation is checked per plane
    and slab; invalid parameters, nonfinite samples and cancellation are typed
    errors. *)
