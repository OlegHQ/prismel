(** Explicit bridge to Rays's renderer mesh. Triangle-ready point position
    and normal planes and indices are shared without copying. Point and vertex
    [N], [Cd], and [uv] attributes are preserved; primitive [Cd] is expanded
    to corners when neither vertex nor point [Cd] is present. RGB float3 [Cd]
    gets opaque alpha; float4 retains alpha. Vertex-owned attributes cause
    deterministic corner expansion because Rays's render mesh has one
    attribute tuple per render vertex. Both values remain immutable. *)
