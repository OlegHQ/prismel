# SDL3_image conformance fixtures

The `sample.*`, `palette.gif`, `rgbrgb.png`, and `svg.svg` files are unmodified
SDL3_image 3.4.4 test assets from commit
`bec9134a26c7d0f31b36d6083c25296e04cabff5` (`release-3.4.4`).  They cover
every still-image format for which that stable upstream release ships a test
fixture.  Prismel uses them under SDL_image's zlib license:

`orientation-6.jpg` is the unmodified upstream `sample.jpg` byte stream with a
minimal EXIF orientation-6 APP1 segment inserted by Prismel's OCaml fixture
tool. `alpha.svg` is a Prismel-authored two-pixel half-transparent/opaque
fixture. Regenerate the oriented JPEG with:

```sh
dune exec tools/sdl3/generate_image_fixtures.exe -- \
  test/sdl3_image_fixtures/sample.jpg \
  test/sdl3_image_fixtures
```

The same OCaml tool writes the Prismel-authored minimal ILBM and XV fixtures
for the two legacy still-image decoders that upstream tests but does not ship
as files in its source tree.

The conformance test decodes every file both by path and from copied bytes,
normalizes to tightly packed RGBA8, compares the common 23×42 source image
across lossless formats, checks alpha independently, and verifies the EXIF
rotation by exact pixel mapping.
