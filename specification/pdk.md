# Packed Development Kit

Status: first production-oriented vertical slice implemented.

## Purpose and boundary

`prismel.pdk` is Prismel's native OCaml compute-geometry layer. It is inspired
by the data-oriented parts of Houdini's HDK, not a source-compatible HDK or an
interpreted VEX clone. Its public values are immutable and target-independent;
builders and kernels use locally owned mutation over packed storage.

```text
procedural / geom / examples ──> pdk ──> prismel ──> runtime ──> wap
```

PDK must not import Geom, Procedural, Runtime, Wap, SDL, or browser code. The
only renderer boundary is conversion to `Prismel.Mesh.t`. Native, headless,
and web therefore render identical geometry through the existing renderer.

## Geometry model

A geometry detail has four attribute owners: detail, point, vertex, and
primitive. Vertices are primitive corners and reference shared points. Forward
topology is stored as packed integer arrays:

- `vertex_point[vertex]` identifies the referenced point;
- `primitive_offsets[primitive..primitive+1]` selects the primitive's vertices;
- a compact primitive-kind byte plane distinguishes open/closed polylines and
  polygons. A point cloud has points and no primitives.

This representation preserves hard normals and UV seams without duplicating
point positions. Render-oriented triangle expansion happens only at the mesh
bridge. Topology validation is linear in points + vertices + primitives and
requires every point reference and primitive span to be in bounds.

`Topology_index` is the shared reverse-topology layer for modeling kernels. It
builds primitive/corner adjacency, next/previous corners, manifold opposites,
undirected edge incidence, and point-to-corner CSR planes with a specialized
open-addressed integer table. It uses expected O(vertices + edges) time and
O(points + vertices + edges) memory without tuple/list allocation in its edge
insertion loop. Boundary and non-manifold edges remain explicit rather than
being forced into a two-sided manifold representation.

Native edge groups are deliberately separate from point/vertex/primitive
bitset groups, matching the topology-affine nature of HDK edge groups. An
`Edge_group.t` indexes the unique undirected edges of one immutable
`Topology_index.t`; cross-topology installation is rejected instead of
silently reinterpreting bits. The reverse topology is held in a thread-safe
weak cache keyed by physical immutable topology identity, so consecutive SOPs
share it without retaining dead geometry. `Topology_index.create_uncached`
keeps cold construction measurable and explicit.
`Edge_group.remap` maps canonical source endpoints through an explicit
source-to-target point plane, drops deleted/collapsed edges, and unions
many-to-one results. Point/primitive Sort, Triangulate, Reverse, Delete with
optional compaction, direct point compaction, Merge, Fuse, and Mirror use this
boundary or its exact equivalent. Duplicate and Copy to Points validate their
copy-major topology and replicate edge ordinals directly, avoiding a large
target reverse index. Subdivide derives its child-edge ordinals directly from
the deterministic quad/triangle refinement plan, so propagated and resulting
crease groups do not retain a full target reverse index;
Clip maps only fragments whose endpoint provenance lies on that source edge;
Poly Extrude maps bottom and every selected-component layer copy; curve
Resample maps intervals;
Edge Divide maps each selected source edge to every resulting child segment;
and Sweep maps source edges to longitudinal edges. Newly generated diagonals,
cuts, caps, verticals, and rings are not mistaken for selected source edges.

Copy-to-Points piece matching accepts a target point integer/text attribute and
prefers a same-named source primitive attribute, then a source point attribute.
Absent source attributes permit only integer primitive-number selection.
Primitive pieces compact referenced points; point pieces retain every matching
point, including free points, and include only primitives whose corners all
reference that same piece. Dense piece IDs, primitive/vertex maps, and target
partitions are planned in shared passes. Unique piece batches reuse the uniform
copy kernel, then one packed point and primitive permutation restores stable
target-major order. Attribute/group payload, ordered memberships, detail facts,
and native edge groups follow the same maps. For source size S, target size T,
and expanded output O, expected work is O(S log S + T + O) in the current
partition implementation; auxiliary storage is O(S + T + O), excluding the
immutable result. Fixed piece count and already coherent point pieces reduce
planning to linear work. Unmatched targets contribute no output, cancellation
is atomic, output cardinalities are checked before batch cooking, and domain
scheduling cannot affect element order.

Poly Extrude retains its exact allocation-tight individual-face compatibility
path. Its general planner accepts a primitive group, splits connected regions
at topology-affine edge groups, assigns stable component IDs in source-
primitive order, and creates one `(component, point)` association per shared
front point. Selected-face normals are accumulated in stable corner order and
normalized once per association; straight division layers are then filled into
exact-sized packed position/topology arrays. Only selected-region boundary
corners create side quads. Unselected polygons and curves pass through, while
selecting a curve or touching a non-manifold edge in connected mode fails
atomically. Point, vertex, primitive, and detail attributes and ordinary groups
remap by stable ancestry; stale point/vertex `N` is removed. Source native edge
groups map to the retained bottom and every generated layer, and optional
front/back boundary groups are native edges. The edge-output path constructs a
specialized endpoint table in target edge-number order instead of retaining a
complete target reverse-topology index.

For fixed division count, the planner is expected O(points + vertices +
primitives + edges + output payload) time and O(selected topology + output)
auxiliary memory. Division work is linear in the generated side rows and front
points. Face normals, positions, topology spans, attributes, groups, and edge
table preparation use disjoint stable ranges where profitable; component union
and association numbering remain sequential so one-domain and multi-domain
outputs have identical point/primitive ordering.

Poly Fill discovers one-sided polygon boundary components through the shared
topology index. With no explicit edge group every valid hole participates; a
native edge group may name one edge or several edges in a hole and the planner
auto-completes the entire component. Components are ordered by their smallest
stable source edge. Every selected component must have exactly one incoming
and one outgoing boundary half-edge at each point, so branches, open chains,
point-touching loops, and inconsistent source winding fail before output is
allocated. A supplied non-boundary or curve edge is also an error rather than
an implicit topology guess.

Single Polygon emits one reversed-boundary N-gon. Triangles use deterministic
dominant-plane ear clipping and preserve concave contours. Triangle Fan adds
one scale-safe arithmetic-mean center and one triangle per edge. Patches oppose
the source boundary half-edges by default, producing a consistently oriented
two-sided manifold; explicit reversal is a deliberate modeling control.
Boundary points remain shared unless unique patch points are requested.
Existing topology is a byte-exact prefix. Generated boundary points and
corners copy stable point/vertex ancestry, numeric fan-center attributes use a
scale-safe mean, discrete/array centers select the first stable boundary
ancestor, and patch primitive fields select an adjacent source primitive.
Existing ordinary primitive/vertex groups do not acquire generated elements;
duplicated boundary points retain point-group ancestry, an optional patch
primitive group marks the new faces, and source native edge groups remain on
their source edges.

The edge-group path does not construct an unrelated target point/corner CSR.
Because source topology is an unchanged prefix, every source edge ordinal is
also a target prefix ordinal. Single shared patches add no edge; fan spokes and
all unique-point edges have cardinality known directly; shared triangulation
checks only its stable ear diagonals against the source endpoint table. The
resulting exact target edge count is enough to extend source packed bits.
Boundary planning plus N-gon/fan output is O(points + vertices + primitives +
edges + output payload); ear clipping is O(sum(loop_size squared)). Auxiliary
storage is linear. Candidate classification, loop validation/triangulation,
center computation, topology fills, attribute interpolation, and packed group
passes use deterministic disjoint ranges where profitable.

Ordinary `Group.t` values retain packed membership and may additionally carry
an explicit element-order plane. `Group.iter` deliberately keeps its legacy
increasing-index contract; `Group.iter_ordered` observes the explicit sequence
when present. Ordered construction rejects duplicate or out-of-range elements
and public order access returns a defensive copy. Union and xor retain the
left sequence followed by unseen right members, intersection follows the left
explicit sequence (or the right when only it is ordered), and difference
filters the left sequence. Complement becomes unordered because newly selected
elements have no source sequence. Sort, deletion, duplication, curve topology
edits, subdivision, clipping, and the shared ancestry remappers preserve order
without changing packed membership behavior; newly derived elements with no
single ancestor append in stable target order.

`Spatial_index` is the shared balanced point-query layer. It stores one
deterministic median-partitioned source-index plane, orders equal distances by
source index, and supports allocation-free bulk nearest/k-nearest traversal
into fixed-width disjoint result slices. Attribute Transfer builds this plan
once and reuses its source IDs/distances for every selected typed attribute;
it never repeats an all-pairs search per attribute. Optional packed point
groups restrict indexed sources and queried targets while preserving original
source IDs and untouched destination values. Construction ranks globally
non-flat axes by span, omits flat dimensions from its split cycle, and builds
disjoint subtrees through the reusable domain pool above a tunable grain. This
avoids pathological planar-grid traversal through constant coordinates while
preserving exact query-result ordering.

Point and primitive-barycenter Attribute Transfer may use nearest,
inverse-distance, or compact Links, RenderMan, and Hart source weighting. The
three compact formulas match the exact expressions published by SideFX; a
finite non-negative radius is independent of the destination distance
threshold, and the positive maximum sample count bounds k-nearest query
storage. A zero radius or a row with no supported candidates falls back to the
stable closest source. Numeric fields share one normalized coefficient table;
the query distance table is rewritten in place only after blend-band influence
has consumed its closest distance, avoiding another O(targets * samples)
plane. Discrete fields retain the stable closest source.

`Surface_index` is the corresponding packed polygon-query layer. It validates
finite non-degenerate simple polygon contours, deterministically ear-clips
N-gons into an internal triangle plane without materializing replacement
geometry, and retains every original primitive and corner identity. Optional
primitive and vertex bitsets intersect the eligible surface. Vertex selection
uses an explicit all-corners or any-corner rule on each emitted triangle;
primitives with no selected corner are skipped before validation, and an empty
eligible surface is a valid index whose queries all miss. A packed
median-split AABB hierarchy emits closest primitive/triangle IDs, squared
distances, and barycentric coordinates into disjoint fixed-size planes.
Triangulation, validation/bounds preparation, hierarchy subtrees, and query
ranges parallelize at explicit grains. Equal-distance ties select the lower
original primitive and then the lower stable internal triangle. Ear clipping
is O(sum(c squared)) over polygon corner counts; BVH construction is O(t log t)
time/O(t) storage and ordinary queries are expected O(log t), while overlapping
bounds retain the documented O(t) worst case.

Every immutable snapshot carries a process-local geometry identity, a topology
data ID, and data IDs for changed attributes and groups. These IDs are cache
invalidation facts, not serialized content hashes. Published buffers must not
be mutated or aliased by callers.

Clean is an explicit ordered composition over the same packed geometry core,
not an alternate repair representation. Optional NaN-point removal precedes
point consolidation so the Fuse spatial index never receives an invalid
coordinate. Consolidation precedes degeneracy classification because welding
may collapse faces or curves. Overlap deletion and winding reversal operate on
the surviving topology, followed by optional point compaction and atomic
attribute/group metadata cleanup. Every intermediate value is immutable; a
later validation or cancellation failure cannot expose a partially cleaned
snapshot.

Polygon degeneracy compares vector area against the square of the user's
edge-length tolerance. The common triangle path computes directly in packed
ranges; finite arithmetic overflow falls back to coordinate-normalized cross
products, preserving decisions through extreme finite magnitudes. General
polygons use the same signed vector-area rule, and polygon curves compare
robust accumulated edge length directly. Point-identical polygon overlaps are
canonical under cyclic rotation and reversed winding. Triangles use a sorted
three-index signature; N-gons use linear-time minimal cyclic rotations and a
specialized open-address table. Stable source order selects the retained
representative. Expected time is O(points + vertices + primitives + output)
for bounded primitive degree, with O(points + primitives + output) temporary
storage. Classification/signature preparation is parallel; stable overlap
insertion and deletion planning remain sequential so domain count cannot alter
ancestry or diagnostics.

## Attributes and groups

Attributes are resolved by name, owner, storage, tuple width, and semantic role
before a hot loop. Numeric data uses packed component arrays; a point is not an
allocated OCaml record. `Attribute_pattern` compiles whitespace-separated
full-name globs once. Blank/`*`, leading-exclusion defaults, left-to-right
include/exclude overrides, `*`, `?`, byte classes/ranges, negated classes, and
backslash escapes have structured validation. Matching is allocation-free and
plural operators retain the geometry's stable attribute order. The initial
storage types cover integers, floats, and
two/three/four-component float tuples. Standard semantics include `P`
(position), `N` (normal), `Cd` (color), `uv`, `v`, `id`, `pscale`, `scale`,
`orient`, and `up`.

Attribute lifecycle has exact-name compatibility operations and atomic batch
operations. `Attribute_ops.delete` accepts independent point, vertex,
primitive, and detail patterns, a delete-non-selected keep mode, and optional
reference geometry whose owner-matched names act as leading inclusions before
the explicit pattern. `Attribute_ops.rename` applies ordered owner-specific or
all-owner wildcard-capture rules; earlier outputs may match later rules and
destination conflicts explicitly skip, error, or overwrite.
`Attribute_ops.swap` applies ordered owner-specific Copy, Move, and Swap pairs
with aligned wildcard captures across every packed storage kind. Missing-side
Swap copies the side that exists. Canonical point `P` participates as float3:
moving `P` is Copy, while moving another float3 into `P` consumes its source.
All three operations rebuild attribute metadata no more than once, share
packed payloads, retain exact geometry identity on a no-op, and fail or cancel
without publishing partial metadata. Delete is O(attributes + reference
attributes) for a fixed pattern; rename and swap are O(attributes × rules),
with O(attributes + generated attributes) auxiliary metadata.

Attribute Copy is the topology-correspondence path for source and destination
geometry that do not require a spatial search. A point, vertex, or primitive
group supplies ordered source/destination element pairs; cyclic matching wraps
the shorter source selection, integer/text value matching selects the highest
matching source element, and destination integer indices provide explicit
source references. Attribute ownership is independent of group ownership, so a
single correspondence projects deterministically through incident points,
corners, and primitives and is reused by all copied fields of that owner.
Compiled include/exclude patterns and one-glob rewrites select all packed
storage kinds; canonical `P` is explicit opt-in. Identity, ungrouped,
same-cardinality plans structurally share source planes in O(attributes)
metadata work. General plans take O(group elements + projected incidence +
copied payload) time and one destination-sized integer map per selected owner;
conflict-free projections and payload planes fill disjoint ranges in parallel.

Attribute Combine resolves an ordered stack of numeric layers before entering
its hot loop. Every point, vertex, primitive, or detail element independently
reads sources and blend masks from the primary or additional geometry inputs,
using direct element numbers or a cached integer/text correspondence. Duplicate
match values select the highest source element; unmatched sources are zero and
unmatched blend elements have zero influence. Copy, add, subtract, multiply,
zero-safe divide, minimum, and maximum share source scale/add and
reciprocal/clamp/complement/threshold preprocessing. Scalar destinations read
tuple length, scalar sources replicate into tuples, and tuple sources truncate
or zero-extend. Existing destination kind is retained, checked integer
conversion preserves unselected full-width values exactly, and canonical point
`P` participates as float3.

The complete layer stack, clamped per-element blending, overall scale,
component threshold, and component clamps run in one fused traversal over the
typed selection. Output storage is allocated once; no layer-sized temporary is
materialized. Missing-destination inference, scalar creation, missing-attribute
policy, and primary-input source cleanup publish atomically with stable
metadata order. For [n] output elements, [l] layers, and tuple width [w <= 4],
work is O(n*l*w). Auxiliary storage is O(n*w), plus one O(n) output mapping and
one bounded-load packed open-address table per referenced matched input.
Selected elements write disjoint output slots, so one- and multi-domain values
and ordering are exact.

Attribute Interpolate supports both persistent primitive coordinates and
explicit weighted element rows. In primitive mode, destination point, vertex,
primitive, or detail elements carry an integer source primitive number and
float3 source UVW; one fused cook samples explicit mixed-owner point, vertex,
primitive, and detail fields. Triangle barycentrics, Houdini's
bilinear quad orientation, the implicit n-gon center fan, and open polygon-curve
parameterization follow SideFX primitive space. PDK closed polygon curves wrap
the same piecewise-linear boundary parameter. Numeric point/vertex fields use
the corner weights, primitive/detail fields are constant over the referenced
primitive, and integer/text fields choose the greatest-weight corner with
stable local-corner ties. Canonical point `P` and standard float3 `N` are
handled explicitly; `N` is normalized after a nonzero destination blend.

The alternative drivers are immutable CSR integer-number and float-weight
attributes with identical row offsets. Point-number rows accept point/detail
fields, vertex-number rows resolve point/vertex/primitive/detail fields, and
primitive-number rows accept primitive/detail fields. Numeric fields use the
weighted sum; detail numeric values are therefore multiplied by the row sum.
Integer/text fields choose the greatest coefficient with stable row-order
ties. Integer-array and float-array fields use the same stable greatest-
coefficient rule to copy one whole opaque CSR row. PDK does not perform
element-wise arithmetic across variable-length rows: destination blend below
one half retains the existing row, blend at or above one half selects the new
row, and the keep/default miss policy retains/clears it. Array output plans one
source/existing row choice per destination, computes exact packed cardinality,
and copies disjoint value spans in parallel. Optional normalization divides a
nonzero row by its signed sum and uses
the pre-normalization magnitude with the positive threshold to ramp existing
versus interpolated influence. A negative total is divided by that signed
total, yielding a positive unit sum without discarding algebraic coefficient
signs. A signed sum whose magnitude is at most `1e-20` has zero new influence:
existing numeric, discrete, and group values are preserved. Pre-scale is
applied before normalization.
Empty rows use the explicit keep/default miss policy; malformed layouts,
non-finite weights, and out-of-range source numbers fail before publication.

Primitive mode may atomically emit equivalent point- or vertex-number/weight
CSR attributes. Selected valid destinations receive one row per primitive
corner, selected misses follow the miss policy, and unselected/existing rows
are preserved as pairs. The computed rows can immediately drive the matching
weighted mode with exact numeric and discrete results.

Fields may be listed explicitly or expanded from independent compiled
point/vertex/primitive/detail include/exclude patterns in stable source metadata
order. Point patterns can include canonical `P`; duplicate destinations across
explicit and expanded fields fail before cooking.
With group matching enabled, the same point/vertex/primitive patterns select
ordinary source groups. Membership is evaluated as a weighted 0/1 field,
blended with existing destination membership, and thresholded inclusively at
one half after the destination blend. Same-name groups from different source
owners are rejected because
they would collide in the single destination-owner namespace. Output remains
packed: workers own complete destination bytes, so no domain performs a racing
read-modify-write and no byte-per-element boolean plane is allocated.

All selected fields share one topology traversal. Jobs are resolved once into
point/vertex/primitive/detail and numeric/discrete planes, primitive kind is
loaded once per destination, packed output planes are allocated exactly once,
and disjoint destination elements fill in parallel. Invalid primitive numbers
have an explicit keep/default policy. Non-finite coordinates, wrong driver
storage, incompatible destinations, duplicate outputs, and cancellation fail
without publishing a partial snapshot. Positions and ordinary metadata commit
atomically. For `d` destinations, `a` fields, `c` referenced corners or
weighted elements, and `r` copied array values, work is O(d*c*a + r), field
output is O(d*a + r), and auxiliary job metadata is O(a) plus one O(d)
row-choice plane per array field. Computed CSR output adds O(d + total
referenced corners) storage. Structural geometry operations preserve, remap,
concatenate, or select CSR rows directly; numeric operations without a defined
array policy reject them instead of silently dropping data.

Groups use packed bitsets and deterministic increasing-index iteration. Union,
intersection, difference, and symmetric difference are linear in the bitset
word count. Selections and ranges must remain packed interval/bitset values;
hot traversal must not materialize lists or per-element options.

Group Promote resolves one named source before entering its hot loop and uses
the shared reverse topology to convert all point, corner, primitive, and native
edge owner pairs. Touching, complete-containment, and primitive shared-edge
tests scan packed incidence directly without allocating closures per element.
Output bytes are disjoint parallel ranges; same-owner promotion shares the
immutable source bits. Ordinary outputs may instead be emitted directly as one
exact owner-sized 0/1 integer attribute; native edges reject attributes. Group
Promotions compiles include/exclude group-name patterns and aligned wildcard
capture substitutions once per ordered rule. Every rule snapshots its matching
source entries before publishing output, so an output that overwrites another
pending source name cannot change that source's promotion. Later rules observe
earlier groups and may re-promote them. Ordinary and boundary rules share one
cook-local group store and publish group metadata once; integer attributes are
merged once after the group commit. Blank patterns are disabled, unmatched
patterns preserve physical geometry identity, and output count/generated
payload are preflight-bounded before each allocation. Rule order is semantic
and serial, while every matched topology and packed-output pass retains the
reusable parallel kernel.

Group Promote Boundary is the typed boundary-only composition: it borrows the packed
source membership as a virtual integer plane, unions selection discontinuities
with optional point/vertex/primitive attribute seams and requested
polygon/curve unshared edges, promotes those boundary edges, then intersects
with ordinary conversion so elements on the opposite side cannot leak into the
result. It supports every source/destination owner pair, ordinary integer-mask
output, and optional primitive expansion to selected faces sharing any boundary
point. Group Expand uses the same adjacency planes. Fixed
signed steps alternate two packed bitsets and stop when membership stabilizes;
flood fill uses one exact-size integer queue, marking elements as they enter it,
so each element is queued at most once. Empty, full, and zero-step selections
share their existing immutable membership storage. Optional step output is one
exact owner-sized integer plane: base/unreached elements are zero, fixed-step
changes record their first positive iteration, and flood traversal records the
minimum multi-source BFS distance. Native edges reject step output because PDK
does not invent an edge-attribute owner. The constrained point and
edge-connected-primitive paths compile point/vertex/primitive attribute
discontinuities through the same typed boundary kernel used by Group Promote
Boundary and Group Range. Collision groups are independently typed, converted
once to native seam bits, and optionally promoted once to a containment mask
and boundary mask. Growth checks candidate policy and seam crossing before
publishing membership; shrinking treats compiled seams as forced first-step
boundaries. Normal-limited growth compares adjacent target-owner unit vectors.
Geometric normals come from the shared normal kernel; custom point, vertex, or
primitive float3 values map to the target through normalized incident-corner
means. The three mapped normal planes double as disjoint per-target
accumulators, avoiding per-element heap boxes. Zero or non-finite input is
handled explicitly: non-finite values fail atomically and zero mapped vectors
cannot cross a normal-constrained transition. Constraint compilation and
validation are O(elements + incidence + selected attribute payload), fixed
steps are O(abs(steps) * incidence), and flood remains O(elements + incidence).
Vertex/edge constrained targets and seam-constrained shared-point primitive
growth are rejected until a precise topology-boundary contract is available.

Named-group catalog operations share one cook-local mutable name table and
publish one immutable geometry snapshot. Group Range classifies directly into
packed bytes over absolute, relative, length, or balanced-partition bounds;
base patterns are resolved once and periodic filtering performs only integer
arithmetic in the element loop. Its optional connected point/primitive mode
reuses the single connectivity classifier, assigns stable local indices in
ascending element order, and evaluates both range and periodic phase
independently inside every component. Compiled same-owner attribute patterns
reuse Group from Attribute Boundary's zero-copy numeric/discrete planes and
finite float-tolerance checks. Independently typed collision group patterns
become native seam bits: native edges are borrowed directly, while ordinary
point/vertex/primitive membership discontinuities are classified once.
Attribute and collision seams are unioned before the flood. With a non-empty
seam plane, point components omit seam edges and primitive components use
shared non-seam edge incidence; the no-seam path retains shared-point primitive
compatibility. Collision-boundary elements can be excluded from local indexing
through one packed promoted include mask or retained explicitly.

A stable component ID can restrict the pattern to one region. Remove Other
Regions clears every other component; disabling it passes only their existing
base membership through unchanged. The legacy [Range_disconnected] constructor
retains its strict remove-other behavior. The global path retains only its
packed output; connected mode retains component/local-index planes, two
component-bound planes, and configured packed boundary/include masks until the
output is published. The classifier reuses its union-find parent and rank
storage as the stable class output rather than allocating separate root and
class maps.
`group_ranges` exposes Houdini's Number of Ranges multiparm as ordered typed
rules. Blank output names are disabled slots. Later rules deliberately observe
groups published by earlier rules, enabling base, collision, and same-name
merge chains. The functional boundary is atomic to its caller: failure or
cancellation returns no intermediate snapshot, while an empty/all-disabled
batch preserves physical input identity. Rule-level execution stays ordered;
each rule retains the same packed parallel validation, boundary, and output
passes as `group_range`.
Group Combine and Invert operate on bitset bytes rather than materializing
member indices. Group Rename and Delete change only metadata and preserve exact
geometry identity when no rule changes it.

Group Copy builds one target-to-source map per owner rule, then reuses it for
every selected source group. Index matching needs no dense map for points,
primitives, or edges. Default vertex matching uses primitive/local-corner
coordinates. Integer/text attribute matching uses a compact open-addressed
table whose slots store source indices only; the key remains in the borrowed
source attribute plane. Duplicate keys retain the first source index. Output
groups are exact packed target-sized bitsets, group-name conflicts are resolved
before their fill, and target metadata is rebuilt once.

## Construction and execution

Known topology is cardinality-first: allocate exact arrays once, then fill by
index. A builder is single-domain owned. Parallel work may fill only
preallocated disjoint ranges and may not grow topology or mutate the attribute
schema concurrently.

`Pdk.Kernel` is the expert VEX-like surface. Bindings are validated once, then
the same native OCaml loop runs through stable chunks using the process-wide
`Prismel.Parallel` pool. It never creates a pool per operation, task, or frame.
Topology mutation is not permitted inside an element kernel. Reductions use a
deterministic two-phase design and combine partial values in stable chunk order.

The convenience API may expose callbacks returning tuples. Such callbacks are
not described as allocation-free unless benchmark evidence proves it. The fast
path exposes packed arrays and chunk bounds so inner loops allocate neither
element objects nor vector tuples.

## Prismel mesh bridge

The bridge owns polygon triangulation and conventional attribute mapping. When
the topology and packed attribute layout already match Prismel's triangle mesh
layout, immutable shared construction through
`Mesh.Private.create_packed_shared` avoids repacking. Otherwise the bridge
computes the exact output cardinality, allocates once, and expands
point/vertex attributes in deterministic primitive order.

The bridge returns structured errors for invalid topology, missing or
incompatible attributes, unsupported primitives, numeric failures, and
cancellation. It does not render, load SDL resources, or inspect the selected
render target.

Public PDK operations use `Pdk.Error.t` with a stable operation, code, message,
and optional corrective hints. Long-running operators accept `Pdk.Cancel.t`; polling is
outside arithmetic inner loops or amortized over fixed blocks. Procedural cook
contexts share this token directly, so cancellation cannot publish a partial
snapshot.

## Implemented operator surface

The eager layer includes packed point/line/polyline/circle/grid/box/sphere sources;
raw-matrix and typed selected Transform, whole-geometry Match Axis, stable point/primitive Sort,
attribute-driven point/primitive blast, merge,
reverse, triangulate, normals, clean, primitive deletion,
noise displacement, height color, surface scatter, copy to points with the
standard quaternion, normal/velocity-up, post-rotation, pivot, translation,
and scale stack plus packed affine transform overrides and typed source/target
restriction, with last-match-wins packed target-attribute broadcast,
`Nothing` overrides, and target-group boolean algebra,
arbitrary-transform instance materialization, materialized
cumulative/non-cumulative Duplicate, individual-face poly
extrusion, arc-length curve resampling, and circular sweep.

Reverse applies either a winding reversal or a signed cyclic corner shift to
all polygon/curve primitives or a typed primitive group. The same permutation
is applied to fixed-width and ragged vertex attributes, ordinary and ordered
vertex groups, and native edge groups. Point, primitive, and detail planes are
shared. Winding reversal removes stale point/vertex `N`; a cyclic shift
preserves and remaps vertex `N` because it does not change the surface. Empty
selections and shifts that wrap every selected primitive to its original
corner order preserve geometry identity. The kernel validates before commit,
supports cancellation, and fills topology and fixed-width vertex payload in
stable disjoint ranges. Work and owned output are O(vertices + vertex payload),
with no reverse-incidence index required. Houdini's separate U/V hull and
surface controls do not apply to PDK's polygon/curve primitive model.

Transform composes six explicit scale/shear, Euler-rotation, and translation
orders and all six radian Euler orders into one affine matrix. A translated and
rotated pivot frame wraps that matrix, and inverse mode rejects singular
output before cooking. Point, vertex, primitive, and topology-affine edge
selections reuse `Element_selection` promotion to one packed point mask;
positions and attached point/vertex `N` planes then fill disjoint ranges.
Normals use the inverse transpose and may normalize, preserve their original
length, or be rebuilt for every pre-existing normal owner. Singular arbitrary
matrices remove normal planes rather than publishing invalid directions.
Identity and empty selections preserve the immutable geometry object.
Validation/promotion is O(points + selected incidence), while position and
normal work is O(points + affected normal elements) with three exact output
planes per changed float3 field and no per-element heap allocation.

Soft Transform reuses the same selected-point promotion and matrix convention,
then blends each point between its original and fully transformed position.
The Radius metric builds the shared packed point index only over source points
and performs allocation-free parallel nearest queries. Edge distance performs
an exact multi-source Dijkstra traversal over `Topology_index` using geometric
edge lengths. Its fixed point-sized indexed decrease-key heap queues each point
at most once, gives stable point-number ties, and avoids duplicate relaxation
entries. Attribute mode consumes a finite point-float plane either as raw
distance or as a direct extrapolating weight. Linear, quadratic, and cubic
rolloff plus an optional exact output weight plane are common to all modes.
Complete geometric selections bypass distance construction with a constant-one
plane. Position/falloff fills are parallel; edge queue order is deliberately
serial and deterministic. Radius work is expected O(selected log selected +
points log selected); edge work is O((points + edges) log points), bounded by
the radius, with O(points) distance/heap storage. Existing normals are rebuilt
by default or invalidated explicitly.

Distance Along Geometry promotes independent typed start and affected
selections through the same `Element_selection` boundary and publishes the
edge-path kernel as reusable point-float data. Raw distance uses `-1` for a
point unreachable from every start. Existing output values outside the
affected group survive exactly; a missing distance or mask plane starts with
`-1` or zero respectively. Masks use linear, quadratic, or cubic falloff over
either a finite positive fixed radius or the maximum finite distance among
affected reachable points. A zero maximum maps reachable zero-distance starts
to one and disconnected points to zero.

When raw distance or maximum normalization is requested, stable Dijkstra visits
the complete reachable component. A fixed-radius mask-only cook passes that
radius into the queue and never visits farther points. Start-complete and empty
start sets bypass topology-index construction. The queue is serial and stable;
affected maximum reduction is deterministic, while output planes fill in
parallel disjoint ranges and commit together. Complexity is O((visited points
+ visited edges) log points) time and O(points) scratch, plus exactly one
point-sized array per enabled output. Surface and heat geodesics require
separate robust metric kernels and are not approximated by edge distance.

Distance From Geometry uses the same output and falloff policy across two
reference feature families. Point mode promotes the optional reference
selection to points and queries `Spatial_index`; primitive mode promotes it to
primitives and queries the triangulated polygon `Surface_index`. The affected
selection is independently promoted on the source input. Empty reference sets
produce raw `-1` and mask zero. Existing output values outside the affected
set survive, and both output planes commit atomically.

Each index now exposes a distance-only packed batch query. It writes one
squared-distance plane in stable parallel ranges and retains infinity for
bounded misses, without allocating point IDs, counts, primitive IDs, triangle
IDs, or barycentric planes. Fixed-radius mask-only cooks bound traversal before
the square-root/materialization pass; raw distance and maximum-radius masks
query the complete index. Point-index construction is expected O(r log r) and
queries O(q log r); polygon BVH construction is O(t log t) and ordinary queries
are expected O(q log t), with O(r + q) or O(t + q) owned storage. Degenerate
overlapping BVH bounds can degrade surface queries to O(q*t). Signed
inside/outside distance is deliberately absent until PDK has a robust closed-
solid classification contract; it is not inferred from polygon winding alone.

Distance From Target is the analytic member of the same field family. It
measures each affected point from an origin, an infinite axis, or an infinite
plane. Cylindrical and planar directions must be finite and non-zero and are
normalized once per operation. Planar raw values may be signed, positive along
the supplied normal; spherical and cylindrical signed requests are rejected
rather than given an ambiguous convention. Masks always consume magnitude.

The kernel validates every parameter and source position before publishing an
attribute, preserves pre-existing values outside the affected selection, and
commits raw and mask planes together. Fixed-radius mask-only cooks write the
mask directly without a distance scratch plane. Maximum-radius mask-only cooks
use one point-sized temporary plane; if raw distance is enabled that output
plane doubles as reduction input. Work is O(points), auxiliary storage is
O(points) only for maximum mask-only cooking, and all fills use deterministic
disjoint Parallel ranges.

Triangulate deterministically ear-clips selected simple polygons after a robust
dominant-axis projection. A typed primitive group can restrict the operation;
unselected polygons and curves keep exact topology and payload, while selecting
a curve is a structured error. Point data stays shared. Stable source maps
replicate/remap every fixed-width or ragged vertex/primitive field, ordinary or
ordered group, and native source edge without marking generated diagonals.
Empty and already-triangular selections preserve geometry identity. Planning
computes exact output cardinality before allocation; independent primitive
blocks own their clipping scratch and fill disjoint output ranges. Complexity
is O(primitives + sum selected corner_count² + output payload) time and
O(primitives + output vertices) auxiliary/output storage. Constrained Delaunay
point-set triangulation is a separate future operator, not an alternate hidden
mode of this topology-preserving kernel.

Normals uses one packed kernel for modeling operations, deformation
recomputation, and the public SOP. It emits point, vertex, primitive, or detail
float3 fields using face-area, equal-corner, or vertex-angle weighting. Vertex
output supports a radian cusp angle; the fully smooth case accumulates once per
point and copies to corners, while cusped output precomputes each corner angle
once and evaluates stable incident fans in parallel. Typed point, vertex,
primitive, and native-edge selections are promoted to the requested owner.
Existing output fields remain exact outside the selection; missing vertex
fields receive Houdini-style smooth initialization, while missing fields on
other owners compute over the full relevant owner. Zero results can preserve
an existing value, and computed values can be reversed.

Point-incidence CSR is cached independently from edge incidence so normals do
not construct unused edge hash/half-edge planes. `Topology_index` reuses those
same point arrays when a later edge operation needs the full reverse topology;
there is no second authoritative incidence representation. Point, primitive,
detail, and fully smooth vertex modes are topology-linear. Cusped vertex mode
is O(vertices + sum point_degree²), uses O(points + vertices + primitives)
packed storage, and writes each output corner independently.

The Line source
robustly normalizes a finite direction and fills exact evenly-spaced polygon-
curve or free-point output in parallel. Convert Line emits one canonical
two-point curve per selected unique topology edge, optionally computes
primitive length, compacts unused points, and preserves native edge provenance
while intentionally discarding source corner/face payloads. Its Connect Path
mode invokes the packed PolyPath graph directly—without first materializing
two-corner edge primitives—and exposes finite endpoint distance, endpoint-only,
and isolated-loop closure controls. Length in this mode is the robust total
arc length of each final path.
PolyPath instead cleans the complete unique-edge graph directly: it removes
self/duplicate edges, traces maximal paths through degree-two points, stops at
endpoints and branches, and optionally rewires transitive nearby endpoint
components onto the lowest point number before tracing. Isolated loops are
open curves with a repeated endpoint by default or closed polygon surfaces
explicitly. Point/detail data
retains identity, vertex data follows a stable source corner, primitive fields
reduce to the lowest contributing primitive, and primitive/native-edge groups
use union ancestry. The normal no-rewire path borrows the cached topology
index's unique endpoint planes; it does not allocate or hash a second graph.
Curve Carve extracts normalized arc-length or uniform-edge intervals from an
optional primitive group with packed payload interpolation and exact
source-edge provenance. Unselected polygons and curves preserve their point
sharing, kinds, and payload. Keep Outside emits two parameter-ordered pieces
for open curves but one seam-crossing complement for closed curves; keeping
inside and outside emits all cut pieces with duplicated cut endpoints and
complete primitive/group ancestry. Away from breakpoint mode, a positive Cut
division count partitions the retained inside interval into equal,
parameter-ordered open pieces in one cardinality-planned cook; the default one
preserves the unsplit result. Primitive float attributes can replace or
scale First/Second U independently; only selected values are required to be
finite and ordered. Polygon breakpoint mode moves the interval inward to source
vertices and either retains the two outer breakpoints or cuts/extracts every
vertex within the interval. Its exact-copy path preserves payload and native
edge ancestry without interpolation scratch. Point-extraction mode otherwise
emits an exact number of free points over an inclusive parameter interval,
optionally retaining the selected source curves; point fields and groups follow
the same interpolation policy while removed vertex/primitive payload becomes
correctly empty. Ends changes U closure for selected polygon faces and polygon
curves. Open drops the closing segment; straight close emits a polygon face and
removes a repeated shared terminal corner on round-trip. Shared-seam unroll
repeats the first point reference, while new-seam unroll duplicates the first
position and every fixed/ragged point payload and ordered-group row. Vertex
payload follows exact corner ancestry. Primitive/detail data remains shared,
original closing edges retain native-edge membership, and authored straight
closing edges remain unselected. Unique-corner topology uses primitive-local
edge numbering; shared topology uses one lightweight target endpoint table and
the cached authoritative source reverse index. The curve-only `curve_ends`
entry point delegates to the same kernel. Curve
Join builds either stable input-ordered chains or a globally greedy nearest-end
sequence anchored at the first selected curve, with closest-end orientation,
finite endpoint welding, connected-only partitioning, wrapping, and explicit
generated-edge semantics. A positive subgroup size starts a new result after
each N selected curves. Keep Originals retains source primitives in stable
order and appends joined chains that share the immutable source point plane;
the general topology-index path preserves native-edge ancestry even where a
welded joined corner substitutes a coincident source point. Global ordering
uses a removable balanced endpoint
k-d tree with widest-extent splitting and stable primitive/end ties rather than
an all-pairs scan. Its dependent greedy walk is sequential; endpoint
preparation and topology/payload materialization retain disjoint parallel
ranges.

PolyLoft consumes selected polygon curves or polygon faces as an authored
sequence of cross-sections and constructs triangles without creating or
duplicating points. Each neighboring pair advances one side of a deterministic
zipper according to either the next cross-edge distance or a three-edge
triangle-perimeter objective. Open sections may reverse onto their closest
endpoint pair. Closed sections choose a closest seam through a direct search
for small products or a packed spatial index for large products, then choose
the destination orientation from the adjacent distances. An equal-point-count
rest snapshot can own those geometric pairing decisions while the current
positions remain the rendered output. U wrap closes authored open sections;
V wrap connects the final section back to the first.

Generated corners inherit exact source-section corner ancestry and generated
faces inherit the preceding source section. Unselected primitives remain in
stable order; selected cross-sections are removed by default or retained as a
prefix. The shared topology remapper preserves every packed attribute,
ordinary/ordered group, and endpoint-affine native edge group. A generated-face
group is optional. Stale point/vertex normals are removed and an existing
normal owner may be rebuilt. Zero collinearity tolerance preserves every
triangle whose point numbers are distinct, so metric roundoff cannot change
topology; a positive dimensionless sine threshold is explicit approximate
filtering policy.

Pair planning and filling are O(output triangles); small closest-seam searches
are O(a*b), while large closed pairs are expected O((a+b) log b) with linear
scratch. Exact cardinalities allocate topology and ancestry once. Independent
section pairs, retained topology copies, remapped payload, and normal fills use
stable disjoint domain ranges. The hot triangle loop uses typed `Float.max`
rather than polymorphic extrema and allocates no per-triangle boxes.

Skin is a second public operation over this same packed loft kernel, not a
second topology implementation. For equal-cardinality neighboring sections it
emits one ordered quad `[a_i; a_(i+1); b_(i+1); b_i]` per segment, reducing
primitive and corner storage while retaining the exact PolyLoft alignment,
selection, U/V wrap, source-retention, payload/group ancestry, cancellation,
and normal contracts. Unequal cardinalities use the shared deterministic
triangle zipper. Planning and materialization are O(output corners), with one
fixed-arity plan per independent section pair and no per-face size boxes.
Native spline surfaces and two-input bilinear cross-skins are intentionally not
represented by this polygon kernel.

PolyBridge first decomposes two topology-affine edge selections into simple
degree-two-or-less paths and loops. Open paths begin at their least numbered
available endpoint; cycles and all component ties use stable point/primitive
keys. Source and destination component arrays pair in authored order or by
independently sorting their scale-safe centroids on X/Y/Z and stable component
index. The latter is O(k log k), retains a one-to-one mapping, and avoids the
quadratic greedy matching scan that an early implementation used.

Each paired boundary becomes an indexed section in the same PolyLoft/Skin
planner. Equal cardinalities emit quads and unequal cardinalities emit zipper
triangles. Reverse controls reorder either indexed boundary; automatic closest
endpoint/seam alignment runs before an explicit destination shift for closed
loops. The direct bridge shares existing boundary points and appends to input
topology by default. Exact source-corner/source-primitive ancestry drives the
common topology remapper, so packed payload, ordinary groups, and native edge
groups retain their established policies; generated cross-edges acquire no
invented ancestry.

Path extraction and materialization are O(vertices + edges + output corners)
with O(edges + output) storage. Component arrays use geometric-growth local
buffers rather than allocating the complete selected-edge count per component.
Independent plans, topology fills, payload maps, and normal generation use
stable disjoint pool ranges. One giant bridge retains sequential ordered path
tracing and zipper planning; many independent bridge pairs expose coarse
parallel work. Spine subdivision, curved/external paths, and thickness/twist
are handled separately from this direct no-new-points path.

For equal-cardinality pairs, positive PolyBridge divisions now allocate
`(divisions - 1) * boundary_points` intermediate points and emit one quad per
boundary segment per division. Positions and all numeric point/vertex payload
use scale-safe linear interpolation; integer, text, ragged payload, and
ordinary groups use the nearest endpoint with an exact half-way destination
tie. Detail payload remains shared, primitive payload follows the source
footing, and native edge groups map only through unchanged original boundary
points. Interpolation maps are allocated only when their owner actually has
payload or groups. Stale normals never pass through the topology change, and an
existing point or vertex normal owner can be regenerated after the full cook.

Intermediate point and quad-validity fills parallelize one giant pair by
stable ranges; independent pairs parallelize at pair granularity. Positive
collinearity filtering uses a packed byte decision plane, then allocates exact
face/corner cardinalities. Unequal-cardinality divided bridges are rejected
until a topology-transition policy can preserve explicit source/destination
footing rows; curved/external paths, non-uniform spacing, and thickness/twist
remain audited extensions rather than approximations.

Circular Sweep/PolyWire exposes one operation over two cardinality-specialized
paths. The measured fixed-resolution, unrestricted compatibility path remains
byte-identical. The general path replaces only selected primitive curves,
passes polygons and curves outside the group through exactly, preserves free
points, and samples every selected source edge by a constant or point-integer
endpoint-averaged segment count. A point-integer division attribute selects
each sampled ring's radial cardinality; unequal neighboring rings use a stable
minimal triangle/quad zipper with `a + b - gcd(a,b)` faces and
`3a + 3b - 2gcd(a,b)` corners.

Both paths use scale-safe rotation-minimizing frames, closed-curve holonomy
correction, point-float radius scaling, point-integer snapped seams, optional
point-authored V and projected joint-up fields, and seam-safe side UVs. The
general path supports a constant or outgoing-corner float2 first/last interior
segment placement in normalized source-edge coordinates. Endpoints remain at
zero and one; inclusive placement may deliberately create coincident sampled
rings, while the source edge itself must remain finite and non-zero. Generated
UVs can be disabled without discarding an authored source vertex `uv` field.
Constant U/V ranges or outgoing-corner float4 `(u0,u1,v0,v1)` ranges apply per
source edge; an authored point V field has precedence over the V range. It also
supports opt-in joint buckling prevention at every non-end source point. The
joint tangent is the scale-safe bisector of the incident unit edge directions;
each radial ring point is enlarged by the exact cylinder-intersection miter
factor and clamped by a finite constant or point-float maximum of at least one.
Straight joints remain unchanged, bend-axis-independent sides retain unit
scale, source endpoints remain ordinary rings, and control-only neighbor,
direction, and limit planes are not allocated when prevention is disabled. It
also supports constant Smooth Point, point-float smooth values with the
documented 0.5 threshold, and optional maximum selected-edge valence. A broken
joint duplicates only its source ring and omits the cross-joint transition;
tangent search and frame transport restart independently at each run. Closed
curves rotate deterministically to their first broken source point and become
one or more open runs. Break ends remain uncapped even when ordinary open-curve
caps are enabled. Selected-edge valence uses the shared packed topology index,
and the no-control path allocates no smooth-run planes. An outgoing-corner
integer segment-seam field cyclically remaps the physical ring correspondence
for every transition on that source edge. The same shift is reduced safely for
unequal ring cardinalities, applies to cap ordering and native-edge ancestry,
and preserves logical seam-safe U coordinates without varying halfway through
a subdivided edge. It also supports
optional open-spine N-gon caps carrying seam-aware planar UVs, hard vertex
normals, and a primitive cap group. The general path records exact two-endpoint
ancestry for every sampled ring: numeric fixed-width point/vertex payload is
linearly interpolated; integer, text, ragged payload and ordinary groups use a
documented destination tie at one half; primitive/detail payload remains exact.
Native edge groups propagate to retained edges and to only those longitudinal
wire edges whose normalized radial coordinates coincide, never zipper
diagonals. Ring points, global transitions, caps, payload, groups, and native
edge bitsets fill independent stable ranges; the ordered frame prefix of each
curve remains sequential.

General-profile Sweep is a separate two-input packed kernel rather than a
second mode hidden inside PolyWire. It forms stable backbone-major Cartesian
pairs of selected polygon curves and emits the same point/row/column/quad and
triangle connectivity vocabulary as Grid. Cross sections are interpreted in
local XY with +Y up and +Z along the backbone, while full local XYZ offsets are
retained. Average-edge, central-difference, previous/next-edge, and fixed-Z
tangents feed scale-safe rotation-minimizing frames; closed-loop correction is
performed after distance-weighted roll/twist so a non-integral twist cannot be
concentrated into the closing edge. Conventional point `orient`, `N`, `up`,
`pscale`, and float3 `scale` fields optionally replace or scale that frame.

Both inputs retain point/corner/primitive/detail ancestry. Cross-section fields
and ordinary/native groups use an explicit prefix (default
`cross_section_`) so the two sources do not silently overwrite one another;
backbone and profile native edges map only to longitudinal and ring edges,
respectively, never generated triangle diagonals. Ancestry planes are allocated
only for owners that actually carry payload or edge provenance. Ordered frame
transport remains per curve, but independent curves, global output points,
topology, UVs, attributes, groups, and edge classification use stable disjoint
pool ranges. See the SOP audit for the deliberately unclaimed SideFX controls.

Resample uses the same polygon-curve boundary with either an exact segment
count, a maximum segment length, or both as a deterministic ceiling. It can
equalize every output edge or retain a shorter final edge. Primitive groups
restrict cooking without reordering the stream; primitive float length and
integer count fields override controls, with non-positive fields disabling the
corresponding control and exact pass-through when both are disabled. It
preserves open and closed endpoints/topology, interpolates all point/vertex payloads, and retains
primitive/detail, ordinary-group, and exact traversed native-edge ancestry.
Optional point fields expose input polygon `curveu`, source curve number,
half-adjacent-edge coverage distance, and normalized output tangent. One packed
cumulative-length plane is shared by stable output chunks, so a single long
curve can parallelize without an O(output log input) per-sample search.

PolyFrame constructs normalized coordinate fields without changing topology.
First Edge, Two Edges, Primitive Centroid, and Texture UV produce point-owned
frames; Texture UV Gradient and Attribute Gradient produce vertex-owned frames
so discontinuous UV or arbitrary float2/float3 fields retain their seams.
Empty texture names resolve to `uv`. Typed component selection, configurable
output names, disabled tangent/bitangent outputs, and optional orthogonal
projection with explicit right-/left-handed output are explicit. Existing output values outside the
selection survive unchanged. The implementation shares packed topology and
face/point-normal passes, computes local attribute derivatives directly, and
fills independently owned point, vertex, and primitive ranges through the
reusable domain pool.

Facet is an ordered modeling pipeline rather than a bag of independent flags.
Its current packed stages follow pre normals/unit normalization, Unique Points,
mutually exclusive point or normal consolidation, inline-point removal, polygon
orientation, dihedral-angle polygon cusping, degenerate cleanup, post normals,
and final normal reversal.
The entire ordered pipeline can be restricted to a primitive group. A private
primitive bitset follows topology deletion between stages and is removed before
publication. Empty selection preserves object identity; full selection takes
the original allocation-tight compatibility path. Unselected primitive corners,
winding, and primitive payload remain exact. Point-owned values intentionally
follow referenced-point semantics: a shared point is selected when at least one
selected primitive references it.
The public typed selection boundary also accepts point, vertex, and native-edge
groups. Point membership promotes every incident primitive, vertex membership
promotes its owning primitive, and edge membership promotes every incident
primitive. Promotion validates ordinary owner/length or native topology
affinity, scans stable primitive corner ranges, and materializes one packed
primitive mask before any stage runs. Supplying both the typed boundary and the
legacy pre-resolved primitive group is rejected atomically.
Unique Points gives every referenced corner an
independent point while retaining isolated points; all point storages and
ordered groups follow exact target-to-source ancestry, and one selected shared
native edge expands to every new boundary-edge descendant. Orient Polygons
solves stable manifold component parity, reverses vertex fields/groups with
their corners, retains edge groups by endpoint identity, and rejects
non-manifold or contradictory orientation constraints atomically. Cusp
Polygons splits the incident corner fans at manifold edges whose dihedral angle
strictly exceeds the threshold. It retains the first fan at each source point,
appends later fans in stable incidence order, duplicates every point payload,
and maps native edge groups to every descendant. Classification and packed
materialization are parallel; deterministic iterative union-by-rank keeps fan
connectivity stack-safe and independent of domain scheduling.

Remove Inline Points performs stable, iterative polygon simplification against
the previous-to-next segment with a finite world-space distance threshold. A
linked cyclic work queue revisits only neighbors of removed corners, never
reduces a polygon below three vertices, and passes non-polygon primitives
through unchanged. Exact target-to-source planes preserve point, corner,
primitive, detail, ordinary-group, and native-edge ancestry; pre-existing
isolated points survive while points orphaned by simplification are compacted.
Scale-normalized predicates remain translation robust at extreme finite
coordinates, and unchanged inputs retain geometry identity.

Consolidate Normals uses the same deterministic representative-bounded spatial
clustering core as Fuse without changing point positions or topology. Point
`N` averages cluster members; vertex `N` averages every incident corner of the
cluster's points. Both owners may coexist, arithmetic averages retain their
natural magnitude, and scale-normalized accumulation prevents finite extreme
vectors from overflowing. Stable cluster-member CSR planes preserve exact
source-order sums across domain counts, while disjoint cluster reductions and
normal fills use the reusable domain pool. Missing normals are an identity
operation; invalid storage and non-finite values fail atomically.

Make Planar projects every selected non-planar polygon onto its centroid plane
using a scale-normalized Newell normal. Triangles, polygon curves, and polygons
already planar to the floating-point noise floor preserve identity. A selected
polygon with a non-finite corner, no stable plane, or a projection outside the
finite coordinate range fails atomically with its stable primitive index.
Exclusive points move in place. When one source point belongs to an unchanged
primitive or to several independently projected polygons, only the conflicting
corners receive duplicated points; this guarantees every transformed polygon
is planar without moving an unselected neighbor. All point storage kinds,
ordinary groups, and native edge ancestry follow the exact source-point map.
Classification and projection use disjoint primitive/corner ranges; stable
point claims and output numbering remain independent of domain scheduling.

Circle is the packed polygon-curve implementation of SideFX's circle/ellipse
and arc contract. The compatible default remains a closed XZ circle. Independent
radii produce ellipses; XY, XZ, YZ, and scale-safe custom axes place the curve;
center, positive uniform scale, in-plane radians rotation, and reversed
traversal complete the polygon transform surface. Typed arc modes emit a full
closed curve, an open sampled arc, an endpoint-chord closed arc, or a closed
pie-slice boundary with one center point. Closed PDK topology is canonical and
does not duplicate the first point.

For `s` segments, a full circle emits exactly `s` points/vertices, an open or
chord-closed arc emits `s+1`, and a sliced arc emits `s+2`; every mode emits one
curve primitive. Position and identity-index planes are allocated once and
filled together in fixed disjoint ranges. Exact arc endpoints bypass accumulated
parameter error. Work and output are O(points); auxiliary error storage is
O(ceil(points / grain)). No point tuple, list, builder growth, or temporary
geometry survives the source cook.

Grid accepts either division counts or Houdini-style point counts. Its output
can be free points; one open polyline per row, column, or both; quads; regular
or reverse diagonal triangles; or checkerboard alternating triangles. The
plane is XZ, XY, YZ, or a caller-defined pair of axes. Custom axes use
scale-safe normalization and Gram-Schmidt rejection, then an optional in-plane
rotation; the resulting normal is the normalized vertical-by-horizontal cross
product. Width and height are independent, `size` remains the compatible
shared default, and an optional point float2 field stores normalized lattice
coordinates.

For `u` by `v` output points, Grid emits exactly `uv` points. Rows and columns
emit respectively `(uv, v)` and `(uv, u)` vertices/primitives; both emit
`(2uv, u+v)`. With `c=(u-1)(v-1)`, quads emit `(4c, c)` and triangle modes emit
`(6c, 2c)` vertices/primitives. All cardinalities are checked before allocation.
Point rows, line primitives, surface cells, and offset planes are written to
disjoint stable ranges through the reusable pool. Time is
O(points + vertices + primitives); auxiliary storage beyond the exact output is
O(ceil(rows / row-grain)) for deterministic numeric-error reporting. There are
no per-point objects, lists, append pipelines, or scheduling-order-dependent
indices.

Surface Scatter plans only selected polygon faces, ignores curve primitives,
and ear-clips simple concave N-gons directly into source-corner triples without
materializing a second geometry. A Walker alias table gives O(1) triangle
selection per output point. Fixed-total density can be point, vertex,
primitive, or detail float storage; negative values contribute zero. For
point/vertex density, triangle integrals use the exact mean of the linear
corner field and samples use the corresponding mixture of Dirichlet(2,1,1)
distributions, rather than merely weighting whole faces. General attribute and
ordinary-group patterns reuse Attribute Interpolate through exact three-entry
source-vertex/weight rows; those CSR rows and original primitive numbers can
also remain as public provenance for later deformation cooks. Direct triangle
meshes avoid triangle-map storage. Position, normal/color, provenance, and
alias buffers are exact-sized, point ranges allocate nothing per sample, and
all published ordering is exact across domain counts. Planning is O(sum of
selected polygon corner-squared ear work), sampling is O(output points), and
auxiliary storage is O(emitted triangles + output provenance).

Ray and closest-surface projection share `Surface_index`, the single packed
polygon collision core. The index ear-clips simple N-gons while retaining the
original primitive and source-corner identities, then builds a median-split
AABB hierarchy over compact structure-of-arrays bounds and triangle maps.
Directional traversal normalizes constant or point-owned directions robustly,
supports forward/reverse/bidirectional and first/last-surface policies, and
uses an exact closest-triangle check for world-space border tolerance instead
of a shape-dependent barycentric epsilon. Selected queries and output/import
ranges write disjoint exact arrays. Hits can retain original primitive plus
source-vertex/weight CSR provenance, so later operations reconstruct collision
fields without exposing internal triangulation. Multi-ray projection retains
one exact unjittered direction and derives every extra cone-disk sample from a
stable seed/point/sample key. Each worker owns O(samples) result/order scratch;
average, upper-median, shortest, and longest reduction cannot leak scheduling
order into output. Average attribute import sizes exact CSR rows first and
repeats only the chosen directional sample set, avoiding a
points-by-samples temporary hit matrix. Collision construction is
expected O(corners + triangles log triangles) time and O(triangles) storage;
ordinary queries are expected O(log triangles) each and sampled projection is
O(points * samples * log triangles), with an additional O(samples log samples)
per point for the median combiner. Queries can degrade to
O(triangles) for completely overlapping bounds. Operation storage is
O(triangles + source points + requested imported output + domains * samples),
apart from output-sized average provenance.

`Ops.materialize_instances` is the single editable-topology boundary for an
arbitrary ordered transform array. It computes point, vertex, and primitive
cardinalities before allocation, emits exact transform-major topology, repeats
ordinary attributes/groups and topology-affine edge groups with stable
ancestry, and transforms typed point/vertex normals by normalized inverse
transpose. If any applied matrix is singular, typed normals are removed
atomically; other payloads remain intact. Zero transforms produce valid empty
topology while preserving detail attributes, and `apply_transform=false`
materializes prototype-space copies. Position, topology, attribute, group, and
normal planes use deterministic disjoint ranges, cancellation never publishes
a partial snapshot, and auxiliary storage is O(instances) beyond exact output.
Unrestricted `Duplicate` constructs its transform sequence and invokes this
same exact-copy kernel. Its primitive-restricted path retains the full input as
an exact prefix and plans stable selected primitive, corner, and referenced
point maps once. It then fills only appended selected payload, with ordinary
and ordered group ancestry, native-edge ancestry, and normalized
inverse-transpose normals. Optional one-based copy groups are built as bounded
packed bitsets in one metadata commit; same-name primitive membership is
replaced or explicitly preserved by union. No compact/materialize/merge
intermediate is retained, so auxiliary memory remains linear in input maps plus
exact output rather than duplicating the output snapshot.

UV Project creates packed vertex float2 coordinates through arbitrary
planar frames or cylindrical/spherical frames, with finite-input validation,
primitive restriction, output ranges, per-primitive wrap correction, and pole
repair. UV Transform applies translation, non-uniform scale, rotation, and
pivot to point- or vertex-owned float2 UVs with owner-matched group
restriction. UV Auto Seam classifies compact undirected topology using angle,
boundary/non-manifold, primitive partition, and existing-UV continuity rules;
it emits a native edge group and optional stable primitive island IDs while
retaining an outgoing-corner compatibility view. Edge Group exposes
the same native topology layer directly with incidence, length, and primitive
filters. Its angle basis is either the dihedral between two incident polygon
faces or the angle between every pair of selected edges sharing a point; an
edge matches the latter when any pair lies in the inclusive range. Edge
directions use normalized SoA scratch, including near `max_float`, and the
final topology-affine membership is written directly as a bitset. Dihedral
classification is O(edges + polygon corners); incident-edge classification is
O(edges + sum(point degree squared)), which is the required pairwise work,
with O(edges) numeric scratch. UV Unitize fits either individual faces or connected UV islands to the
unit square, with optional aspect preservation and explicit seam cuts. UV
Flatten splits corner charts on native or compatibility seams, validates each
triangle island as a manifold disk, maps its boundary by 3D arc length to a
convex circle, and solves positive mean-value harmonic coordinates. UV Relax
uses the same chart and solver while preserving existing boundary coordinates.
The matrix-free diagonally preconditioned conjugate-gradient passes report
non-convergence, collapsed triangles, and flips instead of publishing partial
UVs. The
normal/edge and bounds/output stages use deterministic disjoint parallel
ranges; island union is sequential so work-stealing cannot affect component
IDs. These operations preserve topology, positions, unrelated
attributes, and groups by identity. Deterministic Fuse supports exact/tolerance
clustering, named point restriction, explicit position/attribute policies,
point-group union, and optional attribute-seam matching. Unselected points are
neither queries nor implicit targets. Its fixed-target planner accepts a
read-only second geometry or a separate same-geometry target group. Packed
near-point cells select either the least eligible target number or closest
target with stable ties; an alternate direct integer map implements specified
targets. Non-negative point radii expand the distance threshold, scalar
float/integer/text match fields filter equal or unequal candidates, and output
metadata records mapped queries and target numbers. Query ranges and position
writes are parallel and allocation-free inside the candidate loop. Snap-only
mode shares unchanged topology and payload; optional exact consolidation
reuses the original Fuse cluster/remap core. Same-input Modify Target converts
stable query/target links to deterministic minimum-root components and reduces
both sides. Its position policies cover least/greatest point, average,
component minimum/maximum/mode/upper-median/sum/sum-squares/RMS, weighted
average/sum, and minimum/maximum weight; weighted policies consume one finite
scalar point plane and fail atomically on an invalid or zero-denominator
result. Keep Fused Points rewires topology but keeps all point records.
Optional cleanup removes consecutive duplicates and resulting sub-cardinality
polygons/curves, with either newly orphaned or all-unused stable point
compaction. Complete vertex/primitive attribute, ordered-group, and native-edge
ancestry is preserved. Ordered point-attribute rules provide numerical,
string, weighted, scalar-to-array, and existing-array concatenation policies;
point-group rules provide least/greatest, union, intersection, and strict
majority. Fixed targets copy matching payload and target-only groups through
the selected target map, while Modify Target reduces both sides. Rule patterns
are compiled and generated output metadata is committed afterward. Grid Snap
writes selected positions into
exact packed planes using positive per-axis spacing, normalized offsets, stable
nearest/down/up rounding, and optional Euclidean movement tolerance. Its moved
membership uses one packed bit per point with byte-aligned worker ownership;
optional consolidation delegates to Fuse at zero tolerance instead of owning a
second weld algorithm. Snap-only work is O(points + output payload) time and
three position planes plus O(points / 8) transient state. Fuse cluster discovery
is stable source order so earliest-representative semantics do not depend on
scheduling; exact-sized position, attribute, topology, and group remaps are
parallel.

Bound converts an optional typed point, vertex, primitive, or native-edge
selection to referenced points through the shared topology index. Range-local
min/max values reduce in stable order; cheap million-point reductions retain a
measured sequential cutoff, while larger or incidence-heavy inputs keep the
parallel path. Divided boxes compute all six face cardinalities before
allocation and fill disjoint face-local position, normal, triangle, and winding
ranges. Bounding spheres start from the selected AABB diagonal, then apply
asymmetric padding as center/radius changes to the shared UV-sphere generator.
That generator now allocates exact packed position, normal, and topology arrays
and fills points/triangles directly, with no per-triangle point tuples. Optional
detail center/radii and the all-output primitive group are committed only after
successful geometry construction. Bounds reduction is O(points + selected
incidence); box output is O(surface divisions), sphere output is O(segments ×
rings), and auxiliary/output memory is exact linear storage plus range-local
min/max values.

Match Size separates three roles that Houdini exposes independently: the
component selection to move, the source selection used for justification
bounds, and the target selection used for reference bounds. Each typed
selection resolves to referenced points through the shared topology index.
The target may instead be an origin-centered unit box or an explicit finite
center/size box, so the eager PDK API does not require a synthetic geometry
input for numeric matching. Source and target anchors are independently
continuous from minimum through center to maximum on each axis. Translation
enable, world offset, non-uniform scale enable, and the scale multiplier are
also per-call immutable facts.

Scale modes include independent stretch, uniform X/Y/Z axis matching,
contain, cover, and total primitive perimeter, surface-area, or signed-volume
matching. Metric modes reuse `Analysis` and convert ratios to linear scale by
identity, square root, or cube root; non-primitive metric selections and
measureless inputs fail explicitly. Selected positions fill exact copied SoA
planes in disjoint ranges. Point and vertex `N` use the selected diagonal
inverse transpose and normalization; singular output removes stale normals.
Incidence-based move selections compile once to a one-byte-per-point mask so
position and both normal traversals do not repeat topology scans. Bounds are
O(points + selected incidence); bounds-only fitting then costs O(points +
normal payload), while metric fits add O(vertices) perimeter work or the
documented polygon-measure triangulation. Transform stash/restore remains out
until PDK has an unambiguous detail-matrix storage type.

Sort reorders point or primitive ownership while preserving every dependent
packed plane. Point permutations rebuild topology point references and remap
point attributes, ordinary/ordered groups, and native-edge endpoints. Primitive
permutations rebuild CSR spans and remap vertex/primitive payload and groups.
Restricted value sorts replace only the selected destination slots and retain
stable input order for equal keys.

Point By Vertex Order assigns referenced points by first packed-corner
appearance; By Primitive Index uses the lowest incident primitive. Both place
unconnected points first in stable point-number order. Spatial Locality maps
finite point positions or primitive centroids into a scale-normalized 21-bit
box per axis and sorts the resulting positive 63-bit Morton codes. Coincident
cells retain stable input order. The Morton plane fills in parallel without
tuple allocation and remains finite for coordinates near `max_float`.

Seeded random sorting uses an immutable `Rand.t` stream and an in-place O(n)
Fisher-Yates permutation with no per-element allocation; as in the documented
Houdini contract, this mode rejects group restriction. Reorder-by-index accepts
only an exact integer permutation of all destination indices, or of the actual
selected slots for a restricted sort. Duplicate, missing, out-of-range, wrong-
owner, and wrong-storage fields fail before remapping.

Indirect Sort Indices computes the same permutation but publishes its inverse
destination-rank integer plane without changing topology. Combine mode first
restores the stable order encoded by an existing valid rank plane, then applies
the next stable value key; chained multi-key sorts therefore avoid intermediate
geometry rebuilds. Shuffle and index validation are O(n); value sorting is
O(n log n). Key preparation, inverse-rank output, and all payload remaps use
deterministic disjoint parallel ranges, while comparison order and shuffle are
serial by contract.

Blast by Attribute classifies one same-owner scalar float or integer plane over
points or primitives. Threshold mode is strictly lower-than; range and
center/width modes include both endpoints. An optional packed base group
restricts both normal and inverted selection. The result either replaces one
ordinary same-owner group while sharing all other geometry, or delegates the
selection to the authoritative Delete planner. Primitive deletion may compact
all unused points; point deletion follows Delete's destroy-touched-primitive
contract.

Mode, owner, name, base cardinality, output policy, and numeric data validate
before commit. Operated floating values must be finite; values outside a base
group are deliberately not read or validated. Classification is O(elements)
time and one packed bit per element. Independent output bytes fill through the
reusable domain pool with no per-element boxing; destructive output then has
Delete's O(points + vertices + primitives + payload) time and linear remap
storage. One- and multi-domain results preserve exact element and payload order.

### Crease authoring

Crease operates on PDK's unique undirected topology edges while storing the
result in the vertex-owned scalar `creaseweight` representation consumed by
Subdivide. An omitted selection addresses every edge; a supplied selection is
a topology-affine native edge group. Add reduces all existing incident-corner
values by maximum before adding, matching Subdivide's edge interpretation.
Set replaces the edge value and Delete clears it. Every incident corner then
receives the same value, including non-manifold incidence, while corners on
unselected edges remain byte-exact. Clearing the final positive value removes
the all-zero field.

Optional visualization creates or updates vertex float4 `Cd`. Both endpoint
corners of every positive crease become deterministic red; other vertex colors
remain exact. If no vertex color exists, a valid point float4 color is expanded
as the default, otherwise white is used. This is display metadata only and the
same authored sharpness feeds Subdivide without conversion.

Validation and unique-edge reductions are O(vertices + edges). Set/Delete use
one exact vertex output plane; Add additionally uses one edge plane, and color
visualization uses four vertex planes plus one edge plane. Fixed blocks write
disjoint ranges through the reusable domain pool. Invalid storage, negative or
non-finite sharpness, addition overflow, foreign edge-group affinity, and
cancellation return no snapshot. No-op Add/Delete/Set paths preserve physical
geometry identity.

```

On the four-core aarch64 CI host with OCaml 5.3.0, a 500 by 300 quad grid has
150,801 points, 600,000 corners, and 300,800 unique edges. Seven-run release
medians at grain 16,384 are:

| Cook | 1 domain | 4 domains | allocated, 1/4 domains |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sparse Set | 2.477 ms | 1.129 ms | 4.803 / 4.812 MB |
| sparse Add with incident maximum reduction | 5.344 ms | 2.275 ms | 7.898 / 7.434 MB |
| sparse Delete | 3.769 ms | 1.543 ms | 4.804 / 4.821 MB |
| all-edge Set | 1.747 ms | 0.811 ms | 4.803 / 4.811 MB |
| sparse Set plus endpoint color | 11.519 ms | 8.092 ms | 31.225 / 27.840 MB |

The former manual per-corner Set workflow measured 3.387/3.651 ms and
13.028 MB; the packed kernel is 1.37x faster on one domain and 3.23x faster on
four while allocating 63% less. Manual Delete measured 3.756/3.571 ms and
13.028 MB; the packed result is 2.31x faster at four domains with the identical
hash and 63% less allocation. The manual Add row is not a correctness oracle:
it independently incremented asymmetric incident corners, whereas the new
kernel performs the required unique-edge maximum reduction. The optimized Add
still scales 2.35x from one to four domains. All one/four-domain hashes and
rendered framebuffer bytes match; the complete four-domain benchmark process
peaked at 123,160 KiB RSS.

### Attribute Fade

Attribute Fade is a scalar point-field operation with explicit frame-domain
semantics. For point value `v`, start driver `s`, and hold driver `h`, the
effective start is `retime_offset + s * retime_scale + frame_offset` and the
effective hold is `fade_hold * h`. Before the start the envelope is zero. It
samples the fade-in ramp over the inclusive fade-in interval, holds one, then
samples the fade-out ramp over its inclusive interval and returns to zero. The
result is `v * envelope`. Missing fade/start/hold fields supply one/zero/one;
start and hold accept scalar float or integer storage while the authored fade
field remains scalar float.

An optional point group restricts the multiplication and preserves every
unselected fade value exactly. The start and hold drivers may instead be read
by point number from independent equal-cardinality geometries. Start retiming
is deliberately affine: `(0,1)` reads an attribute in frames, while `(1,FPS)`
maps zero seconds to frame one and each second to `FPS` frames. Visualization
replaces point float4 `Cd` with the faded value on RGB and one on alpha; this
explicit output policy avoids target/backend viewer state.

Both ramps are finite, strictly ordered, endpoint-complete piecewise-linear
tables on `[0,1]`. Durations and per-point hold scales are finite and
non-negative. Selection ownership/cardinality, both reference cardinalities,
all operated values, affine/relative-time overflow, result overflow, attribute
names/storage, grain, and cancellation are validated before publication. An
empty or numerically unchanged edit with an existing fade field preserves
physical geometry identity, even when opaque malformed values exist outside
the selected points.

For `n` points and at most `k` ramp knots, time is `O(n log k)` and persistent
output is exactly one `n`-float plane, plus four `n`-float planes only for
visualization. Inputs, topology, and all unrelated payload remain shared.
Block error/change records use `O(ceil(n/grain))` bytes/integers. The operated
point loop is allocation-free: scalar-plane dispatch and ramp sampling are
inlined, blocks write disjoint ranges, and the reusable domain pool produces
byte-identical ordered results.

The release benchmark uses a 500x300 quad grid (150,801 points), every seventh
point excluded, float fade/start/hold fields, four-knot ramps, frame 137.25,
grain 16,384, and seven medians on the four-core Linux aarch64/OCaml 5.3.0
runner:

| Cook | 1 domain | 4 domains | allocated, 1/4 domains | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| selected four-knot ramps | 1.815 ms | 0.754 ms | 1.212 / 1.215 MB | `3899516654851549430` |
| all points/default ramps | 1.366 ms | 0.564 ms | 1.212 / 1.215 MB | `147492431177321602` |
| selected ramps plus `Cd` | 3.143 ms | 2.185 ms | 6.038 / 6.042 MB | `3597614511156252915` |

The retained manual scalar reference is intentionally unchecked and serial: it
measured 1.314/1.322 ms and allocated 3.620/3.620 MB. The production kernel's
selected-ramp one-domain path pays 0.501 ms for full validation/cancellation,
but allocates 66.5% less; four domains are 1.75x faster than that reference
with the identical result hash. The packed kernel itself scales 2.41x from one
to four domains. Exact one/four-domain attribute, render-mesh, and dedicated
320x240 native-framebuffer regressions pass. The complete four-domain
benchmark process peaked at 64,568 KiB RSS.

### PolyCut

PolyCut breaks selected polygon primitives and polygon curves through a single
packed fragment planner. The point mode marks selection-eligible endpoints of
invalid edges. Remove drops marked endpoints and both adjacent segments; Cut
retains them as independently owned endpoints on the neighboring fragments.
The edge mode instead removes invalid edges or inserts disconnected cut
endpoints along them. A primitive group restricts the source paths, while the
secondary restriction is owner-exact: a point group in point mode and a
topology-affine native edge group in edge mode.

Three detection policies are explicit. All treats every eligible edge as
invalid. Crossing accepts a scalar point float or integer attribute and uses a
scale-normalized interpolation ratio, including exact endpoint crossings; an
edge whose two values both equal the threshold is removed without inventing a
cut position, matching SideFX's published rule. Change accepts scalar or
float2/3/4 point storage, measures absolute or scale-safe Euclidean change,
and, under Cut, emits `ceil(change/threshold)` disconnected subsegments. A
positive threshold is required for that finite-subdivision case. `P` is
available to Change through the canonical packed position plane but is
deliberately rejected by scalar Crossing.

Open fragments remain open. Fragments from a closed polyline or polygon may be
closed when they contain at least three corners; the corresponding source kind
is retained and its new closure edge has no invented source ancestry. Source
points remain shared where no break requires separation. Inserted interior
cuts receive two independently owned points, and point cuts clone only the
outgoing side. Point Remove compacts a source point only when no retained
corner uses it, while preserving pre-existing free points. Edge Remove keeps
the original point domain, as deleting an edge does not imply deleting its
endpoints.

Point and vertex floating payload is linearly interpolated, including normal
renormalization through the shared curve interpolation boundary. Integer,
text, and packed CSR rows use the nearest endpoint. Primitive attributes and
groups follow exact fragment ancestry, detail values are shared, ordered
groups retain source traversal order, and every retained or subdivided native
edge inherits its source edge membership. All output planes are allocated from
precomputed cardinalities and published only after validation.

For `p` points, `v` corners, `r` primitives, and `k` emitted cut subsegments,
time and auxiliary storage are `O(p + v + r + k)` plus linear payload remap.
Edge Remove has a specialized no-interpolation path that shares positions and
point/detail payload, avoids expanded-segment/sample planes, and writes stable
fragment ranges directly. Other modes classify directed edges in parallel,
prefix exact segment/fragment cardinalities, fill disjoint primitive/corner
ranges, compact retained points once, and interpolate output planes through
the reusable domain pool. Lowest malformed operated-field diagnostics,
ordering, attributes, groups, mesh conversion, and framebuffer bytes are exact
between one and four domains.

The release fixture contains 300 independent 501-point curves (150,300
points), a scalar sawtooth crossing field, grain 16,384, and seven medians on
the four-core Linux aarch64/OCaml 5.3.0 runner:

| Cook | 1 domain | 4 domains | allocated, 1/4 domains | Output cardinality | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| edge Remove/crossing | 5.532 ms | 3.479 ms | 8.041 / 7.370 MB | 311,161 | `990841547120428818` |
| edge Cut/crossing | 16.182 ms | 11.839 ms | 60.617 / 37.868 MB | 352,625 | `3032578540479040296` |
| edge Cut/change, threshold 3 | 21.232 ms | 16.519 ms | 86.497 / 53.245 MB | 533,640 | `722701032308820201` |

The retained allocation-heavy serial reference for crossing removal measured
4.321 ms and 11.246 MB. The four-domain packed fast path is 1.24x faster,
allocates 34.5% less, and produces the identical complete geometry hash; it
scales 1.59x from the validated one-domain path. Cut modes necessarily emit
interpolated endpoint and ancestry planes and scale 1.37x/1.29x. The complete
four-domain benchmark process, including all three cooks and Dune/opam runtime,
peaked at 85,048 KiB RSS. Direct PDK, immutable SOP/cache, every-storage,
malformed/cancellation, exact one/four-domain mesh, and visible 360x240
framebuffer regressions cover the operation.

```

### Separate Pieces

Separate Pieces assigns stable dense IDs to the first occurrence of each
integer or text identity, then packs the corresponding geometry into disjoint
projection intervals along a scale-safe normalized axis. The first non-empty
piece remains fixed; later pieces translate so their lower projected bound
follows the previous upper bound by the requested non-negative gap. Components
with one identity share one union bound and one rigid translation even when
they are disconnected.

The identity owner is explicit. A point-owned field must be constant over each
polygon or curve primitive. A primitive-owned field may cover many primitives,
but every shared point must see the same identity. These checks prevent an
apparently rigid piece operation from stretching topology. Free points remain
untouched under primitive ownership. A float3 translation field is written on
the same owner domain; Move Back subtracts it and retains the field. Ordinary
payload, topology, groups, edge groups, and normals remain structurally shared.
Floating subtraction can introduce ordinary roundoff, so Move Back promises
deterministic geometric restoration, not byte-identical source coordinates.

For `p` points, `v` corners, `r` primitives, and `k` pieces, time is
`O(p + v + r + k)` and auxiliary storage is `O(p + k)`. Key compilation,
stable scattered bound reduction, and the layout prefix are sequential.
Point/primitive rigidity validation, projection, translation metadata, and
changed position planes use the reusable domain pool with disjoint output
ranges. Axis-aligned packs share the two unchanged position planes. Missing or
wrong storage, mixed ownership, non-finite operated positions, unrepresentable
projection/layout/output coordinates, invalid gaps, and cancellation fail
before publication.

The release fixture contains 300 overlapping independent 501-point curves
(150,300 points), dense primitive integer identities, gap `0.01`, grain
16,384, and seven warm-index medians on the four-core Linux aarch64/OCaml 5.3.0
runner:

| Cook | Time | Allocated | Cardinality | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| validated packed, 1 domain | 3.313 ms | 3,700,272 B | 300,900 | `3435451684132487927` |
| validated packed, 4 domains | 2.360 ms | 3,711,256 B | 300,900 | `3435451684132487927` |
| retained unchecked serial reference | 2.640 ms | 13,239,208 B | 300,900 | `3435451684132487927` |

Four domains scale 1.40x from the validated one-domain path and are 1.12x
faster than the narrow serial reference while allocating 72.0% less. The
reference assumes dense primitive-to-point correspondence and omits owner,
topology, finite-value, overflow, and cancellation validation. The direct cold
four-domain process, including fixture and topology-index construction, peaked
at 50,204 KiB RSS. Direct point/primitive, integer/text, Move Back,
malformed/cancellation, exact one/four-domain geometry/mesh, immutable SOP
cache, and visible 360x240 framebuffer regressions cover the operation.

Mirror supports arbitrary planes, source retention, corrected
polygon winding, corner/group remapping, and reflected point/vertex normals.
Clip supports arbitrary planes, above/below/all output, tolerance snapping,
polygon curves, polygons, standalone points, optional split connectivity, and
optional manifold caps. A typed point, vertex, primitive, or native-edge
selection is promoted through the shared topology index to incident
primitives; a point selection additionally addresses standalone points.
Selected and unselected primitives that meet at a source point receive
separate output identities, so clipping or snapping the selected side cannot
move the pass-through side. Unselected primitive corner order and payload
ancestry stay exact. The matrix convenience transforms a local origin and
normal into the same world-space plane contract. Clip uses shared boundary
points for watertight caps and vertex normals for a hard shading seam. Numeric
point/vertex payloads are interpolated; integer and text payloads use a
deterministic nearest endpoint; all ordinary attributes and groups, plus
topology-affine edge groups, are copied or remapped in stable order. Generated
primitive and native-edge groups replace same-name input groups by default or
union with their remapped membership when replacement is disabled.
When a half-plane disconnects a concave polygon, ordered clipping-plane
intersections reconnect accepted source-boundary chains into the actual output
cycles. Payload ancestry, cut-edge membership, side groups, and cap segments
follow every emitted fragment. This O(k log k) reconstruction and O(k) scratch
is used only for a polygon with multiple retained boundary runs; ordinary
polygon clips retain exact linear planning. Cap tracing preserves directed
boundary winding. An oppositely wound contained contour is a hole;
same-winding nested solids remain independent, and alternating depth restores
solid islands. Because one PDK polygon has one contour, a component with holes
is normalized, deterministically visibility-bridged, and ear-clipped into
triangles while retaining the original boundary tokens. Every boundary edge
therefore stays shared with the clipped surface, bridge/diagonal edges remain
internal, cap groups include every triangle, and hard cap normals stay exact.
Open, non-manifold, inconsistently wound, intersecting, or unbridgeable cap
graphs return structured diagnostics rather than invalid topology.
Subdivision builds one immutable packed refinement plan for Catmull-Clark,
Loop, or bilinear refinement. Catmull-Clark/bilinear output remains native
quads; Loop remains triangles. Point numeric payloads use the position
stencils, vertex payloads use face-local stencils so seams remain split,
primitive/detail payloads propagate without topology ambiguity, and groups use
documented all-parent membership for generated elements. Semi-sharp vertex or
primitive `creaseweight` and point `cornerweight` affect each level and emit
residual vertex creases for the next level. A second polygon/polyline
topology may define crease edges by matching point-number pairs; positions are
never consulted. A finite non-negative override replaces source weights on
matching edges. Otherwise vertex and primitive `creaseweight` values reduce by
maximum over selected shared-edge incidence and require topology identical to
the source, matching SideFX's attribute-input restriction. The crease input
may use a primitive group, residual edge/corner fields can be suppressed, and
positive residual edges can be emitted as a named native group. Identical
topology reduces independently into disjoint unique-edge slots; subset
topology uses the cached integer edge lookup. Recursive cooks apply the second
input only once and carry exact subdivided sharpness forward.

Open and closed polygon curves are refined by the same public Subdivide
boundary through a dedicated packed one-dimensional planner, not a second
geometry core. Every source segment gains one midpoint. Bilinear refinement
keeps old points fixed; Catmull-Clark applies the cubic boundary rule
`1/8 neighbor A + 3/4 point + 1/8 neighbor B` at unique-edge degree-two
points and pins open endpoints and branches. Shared mode creates one old point
per source point and one midpoint per unique topology edge, so separate curve
primitives can form a continuous graph. `treat_curves_as_independent=true`
allocates each primitive corner separately, making every open primitive's ends
independent even when source point numbers coincide, exactly matching the
documented SideFX option. Loop rejects selected curves because its input must
be triangulated.

The planner counts output points, vertices, stencil terms, and primitive
offsets before allocation. Positions and every scalar/tuple point field use
the point stencil; vertex numeric fields use direct or midpoint-linear rules;
integer, text, and CSR-array rows use stable representatives. Old point and
vertex group members survive, midpoint membership requires both parents,
primitive/detail payloads propagate, and every selected native source edge
selects both child edges. Point `N` follows the same stencil as `P` and vertex
`N` follows the ordinary vertex policy. When `recompute_point_normals` is set
and the input had point `N`, one final area-weighted normal pass replaces both
normal owners with normalized point normals; inputs without point `N` do not
gain it. Recursive levels rebuild only the next packed curve plan. Mixed polygon/curve inputs are
compacted by family, evaluated by the surface and curve planners, concatenated,
and stably restored by source primitive ancestry; local curve selections split
shared identity only across the selected/coarse boundary, and free points
survive once. Whole-curve inputs bypass that partition/sort path. One level is
O(points + unique edges + vertices + attribute payload) time and auxiliary/
output storage. Topology decisions are sequential and deterministic; stencil,
topology, attribute, and group fills use disjoint parallel ranges.

When no second topology is supplied, a finite non-negative crease override
replaces every source edge weight in the subdivided surface. Full refinement
passes the scalar directly into the first crease planner; local refinement
passes it only into the compact selected mesh, leaving coarse unselected edges
unchanged. The planner fills its already-required E-value sharpness plane with
the scalar, so it avoids a synthetic per-corner `creaseweight` field, an extra
edge reduction, and a temporary geometry identity. Later recursive levels use
the ordinary residual child field. Zero cleanly suppresses prior vertex and
primitive sharpness, and optional resulting groups contain exactly the
positive descendants.

Uniform creasing, the compatibility default, subtracts one from the finite
sharpness of both child edges. Chaikin computes each child independently at
its corresponding parent endpoint: `0.75 * parent + 0.25 * mean(other
positive incident creases) - 1`, clamped to zero. A lone positive crease uses
ordinary uniform decay. The packed planner computes the two child values of
every source edge once by point-owned disjoint writes. Current edge masks use
the child pair as OpenSubdiv requires: a sub-unit parent becomes a full crease
when both Chaikin children remain positive, otherwise it retains the ordinary
fractional parent blend. Vertex masks classify both the parent and child
neighborhood as smooth/dart, crease, or corner; differing rules blend by the
clamped mean sharpness of exactly the features which decay to zero. This covers
corner-to-crease and crease-to-smooth transitions rather than approximating
them from the two largest parent weights. Point `cornerweight` continues to
decay uniformly by one at each level.

The same child plan drives point positions, point fields, smoothly constrained
face-varying tuples, recursive vertex `creaseweight`, and each side of the
optional resulting native edge group. It costs O(points + edges) time and
2E floats plus O(points) packed rule/neighbor planes beyond the common
subdivision plan. Values are finite by PDK contract, so OpenSubdiv's separate
infinite-sharpness sentinel is not part of Chaikin's neighborhood mean.

Before constructing that plan, Subdivide scans the source attribute metadata
once for Houdini's five OpenSubdiv detail controls. `osd_scheme` accepts either
integer `0`, `1`, `2` or text `"catmull-clark"`, `"loop"`, `"bilinear"`.
`osd_vtxboundaryinterpolation` uses integer `0..2`,
`osd_fvarlinearinterpolation` uses `0..5` in OpenSubdiv enum order,
`osd_creasingmethod` uses `0`/`1` for Uniform/Chaikin, and
`osd_trianglesubdiv` uses `0`/`1` for Catmull-Clark/Smooth. A present detail
control takes precedence over the corresponding public argument for the whole
recursive or local cook. The immutable fields still propagate as detail
attributes, but are not reparsed at every refinement level. Wrong storage,
unsupported text, and out-of-range integers return a structured error before
crease inputs, automatic boundary holes, or output topology can be published.
Point/vertex/primitive fields with the same names are intentionally ignored.
Resolution costs O(attribute count) time and five option slots; it allocates no
geometry-sized alternate representation.

The canonical `subdivision_hole` primitive group, or an explicit external
group installed under that name, follows SideFX/OpenSubdiv hole semantics:
hole polygons remain in the full adjacency and stencil plan but their
descendant primitives are omitted. Recursive cooks retain and refine the hole
faces internally until the final level, so their influence does not disappear
one iteration early. `remove_holes=false` retains and propagates the faces.
Final topology cardinality is counted before allocation; visible
Catmull-Clark corners or Loop faces fill disjoint stable ranges. Point and edge
stencils intentionally retain the complete source topology, including unused
face/edge points belonging only to holes, because the contract removes faces
rather than pre-deleting their control vertices. Local refinement folds hole
faces into its selected partition so they can contribute without leaking a
coarse copy. Direct child-edge ancestry skips edges with no visible child and
produces a valid zero-edge group for an all-hole surface.
Point-boundary interpolation is a typed OpenSubdiv policy. `Edge Only` is the
compatibility default and evaluates boundary points with the smooth cubic
boundary-curve stencil. `Edge and Corner` uses the same curve stencil except
that a boundary point incident to exactly one face is pinned. `None` follows
OpenSubdiv's finite-sharpness behavior by unioning every boundary-incident
face into `subdivision_hole`; PDK exposes only finite crease weights, so every
topological boundary qualifies. Bilinear's zero-neighborhood rule is
unaffected. Automatic classification scans the cached packed reverse topology
in O(points + edges + vertices) time, stores point and face decisions in
packed bitsets, observes cancellation in both passes, and fills disjoint bytes
in stable ranges. The policy applies recursively through the propagated hole
group and to ordinary point attributes through the same position stencil.

Floating vertex attributes use an independently indexed face-varying channel.
`Subdivide_fvar_none` smooths through every value region; `Corners Only` pins
one-face region corners; `Corners Plus 1` additionally pins junctions of three
or more regions; `Corners Plus 2` additionally pins darts and both sides of a
concave two-region corner; `Boundaries` keeps every value-region boundary
linear; and `All` applies bilinear interpolation everywhere. `All` remains the
compatibility default. Exact equality of the complete float, float2, float3,
or float4 tuple defines continuity, so a seam in any component remains a seam.
Point `cornerweight`, edge `creaseweight`, and Edge-and-Corner point-boundary
rules take precedence over a smoother face-varying policy. Bilinear subdivision
is already Linear All and ignores the option.

The planner first detects globally continuous attributes and reuses the main
geometry stencils and child topology without constructing a second reverse
index. Fully split one-face regions use a face-local fast path. Mixed seams are
partitioned per source point with deterministic union-find, assigned stable
packed value indices, and refined through one value-topology index and one CSR
stencil plan shared by every component of the tuple. Work is
O(vertices + edges + output stencil terms), with O(vertices + edges + points +
stencil terms) auxiliary storage for the mixed case. Every parallel pass owns
disjoint point, corner, component, or output ranges, and recursive refinement
reconstructs the next value topology from the exact computed tuples.

Catmull-Clark triangle refinement separately selects standard Catmull-Clark or
OpenSubdiv Smooth Triangles edge masks. For an interior edge, each incident
triangle proposes face-center weight 0.470 and each non-triangle proposes
0.25; their average is the weight for each of the two face centers, while each
endpoint receives `0.5 * (1 - 2 * face_weight)`. The ordinary mask is therefore
0.25/0.25 for endpoints and face centers, a two-triangle edge uses 0.03/0.470,
and a triangle/quad edge uses 0.14/0.36. Face and point masks do not change.
Semi-sharp interpolation blends this smooth result with the ordinary sharp
midpoint, so a fully sharp or boundary edge is unaffected. The same plan
refines point fields and smoothly constrained face-varying fields. Loop,
bilinear, and Linear-All face-varying interpolation ignore the option. Since
the first Catmull-Clark level emits quads, recursive application naturally
changes only levels that still contain authored triangles. As Pixar documents,
this empirical smoothing rule may prevent independently subdivided meshes from
joining seamlessly when triangles touch the separate boundaries.

Unsupported primitive kinds, selected curves under Loop, repeated surface
points, non-manifold surface edges, invalid surface boundaries, disconnected
surface vertex fans, and zero-length curve topology edges fail before an
output snapshot is published.
An optional primitive group evaluates only its induced polygon mesh and
implements SideFX's Do Not Close policy. Selected and unselected regions are
compacted independently, free points survive exactly once, and only points on
the selection boundary are duplicated. Pull Closed/No Edge Division carries
exact source-edge ancestry through every recursive level, projects each
descendant chain onto its coarse edge, and snaps multi-edge junctions to their
shared source endpoint without welding or proximity matching. Stitch/No Edge
Division inserts deterministic non-degenerate triangle fans between each
refined chain and the two coarse endpoints. The faces share both sides' existing
points, inherit stable coarse primitive and side-corner payload, and leave
generated spokes out of native edge groups. As in SideFX's No Edge Division
contract, the unsplit coarse edge and fan spokes form a non-conforming
T-junction. Pull Closed/Divide Edges materializes the exact coarse descendant
chain, welds it by source-edge ancestry rather than spatial proximity, and
linearly places joined points between the coarse and refined chains using a
finite [[0, 1]] bias. Stitch/Divide Edges retains both chains and emits a
consistently wound two-triangle strip per segment; exact coincident pairs are
welded and their zero-area bridge triangle is omitted. Numeric point and
face-varying payload interpolates along divided coarse edges, discrete/ragged
payload uses a stable nearest parent, generated group membership requires both
parents, and original native-edge membership propagates to every child edge.
Multiple selected fans that touch only
at one point are deterministically split before validation, while edge-adjacent
faces retain shared stencils. Empty selections preserve identity and full
selections retain the original whole-mesh output ordering and hash. Pull and
Stitch Triangulate reuse the shared deterministic ear-clipping kernel only on
surrounding polygons; Pull evaluates the triangulation at the final biased
boundary positions. Enforce Consistent Topology disables position-dependent
coincident-chain welding and bridge-face omission, and replaces geometric ear
selection with a stable source-corner fan. Counts, connectivity, and ordering
therefore depend only on input topology and selection; an exactly coincident
transition may deliberately retain a zero-area face. Geom's public Loop and Catmull-Clark
functions now adapt through this kernel rather than owning duplicate topology
algorithms.
The unified deletion planner accepts point, vertex, or primitive bitsets.
Selected/non-selected inversion is resolved once; a cardinality pass then
either destroys every touched primitive or removes selected corners and heals
the retained polygon/curve order. Invalid undersized results are dropped.
Point deletion always removes selected point records, while optional compaction
also removes all topology-unused points. Positions and point payloads remain
structurally shared when their point map is unchanged; empty deletion is an
identity operation. All changed owner planes and groups remap in stable order,
and healing invalidates normals rather than retaining stale surface data.
`Attribute_ops.promote` covers every ordinary owner pair with stable packed
incidence reductions. Component-wise numeric mode chooses the smallest tied
value and median chooses the upper middle value. Integer/text destination
piece attributes partition reductions, deduplicate contributing source
elements, and restore ascending source-index order; same-owner piece reduction
is supported. Median uses in-place introspective selection, dense integer mode
uses counting, and independent piece ranges use incidence-adjusted parallel
grain. Unsupported lossy integer/text methods return structured errors rather
than silently coercing storage. Scalar integer and float `Array_all` promotion
writes incidence-ordered packed CSR rows directly. `Unique_values` sorts each
independent row with the specialized packed comparator, counts canonical
values, prefix-sums exact row offsets, and fills disjoint result slices;
integer and floating rows use `Int.compare` and `Float.compare` equivalence.
Piece output remaps complete rows with a checked exact-size allocation. Wider
tuples, text, and existing arrays fail explicitly until tuple-width and
text-array storage exist rather than losing shape information.
`Attribute_ops.enumerate` assigns
integer or prefixed-text sequences to point, vertex, or primitive owners.
Restricted groups use stable chunk-prefix ranks, preserve existing values
outside the selection, and produce exact output across domain counts. An
optional same-owner integer or text piece attribute enables both documented
piece modes: Piece Elements restarts the sequence independently within each
piece, while Pieces assigns one dense sequence value to the complete piece.
Distinct pieces are ordered by their first selected element and elements inside
each piece retain increasing owner index, including when the output overwrites
the piece attribute itself. Integer keys use a specialized geometric-growth
open-addressed table; text keys use structural string equality. Stable piece
planning is sequential, while exact owner-sized output materialization remains
parallel. Work is expected O(elements), with O(elements + pieces) auxiliary and
output storage and no per-element option/list allocation in the integer path.
`Attribute_ops.promote_pattern` binds every selected source payload to one
shared topology incidence and optional piece-partition plan instead of
rebuilding the plan once per name. Its optional aligned multi-term destination
and index rules assign one replacement to every positive source term;
exclusions consume no replacement, later matching positive terms win, and
each rule captures `*`, runs of `?`, and runs of character classes before
substitution by wildcard signature and stable position. All rewritten names
are validated before cooking. Selected sources are removed as one immutable
batch before promoted outputs are installed, so overlapping names cannot erase
one another and any failure remains atomic.
For first/last/minimum/maximum scalar promotion, the value and contributing
source-element index fill in one incidence pass. Mode reuses the sorted value
plane and performs one stable lookup in the original relation. Ties retain the
first incidence; piece relations are already unique and source-index ordered.
Index capture rules create a distinct destination-owned integer plane for each
plural scalar value, and empty incidences use `-1` rather than a valid source
number. Float extrema preserve the value kernel's NaN propagation and
signed-zero bits. Float2/3/4 values reduce component-wise and publish one
fixed-width packed integer CSR row per destination, so independently selected
component sources remain exact without expanding the global storage catalog.
Text/index values follow SideFX's documented coercion: Average is upper median,
Sum is incidence-order concatenation, and other numeric methods use First;
explicit First, Last, Mode, and Median retain their ordinary semantics.
`Attribute_ops.transfer_points` and `transfer_primitives` share one typed
proximity plan. Points query canonical positions; primitives query packed
arithmetic corner barycenters. Both support nearest and k-nearest
inverse-distance transfer with bounded distance, explicit miss policy,
deterministic ties, numeric tuple blending, nearest integer/text semantics,
and owner-matched packed source/target restrictions. A full-influence distance
threshold plus linear, smoothstep, or fixed uniform-bias blend band is shared
by point, primitive, vertex, and surface paths. Every zero-width spatial
transfer retains its direct-write hot path and allocates no influence plane.
`transfer_detail` structurally shares selected immutable detail payloads
without copying.
`transfer_vertices` and `transfer_surface` reuse one `Surface_index` plan to
sample point/vertex numeric payloads barycentrically, primitive payloads
constantly, and integer/text payloads from the largest barycentric corner into
target point, vertex, or primitive planes. Target vertices query their
referenced point positions; target primitives query arithmetic barycenters.
The surface path optionally records closest distance, normalizes interpolated
`N`, and supports bounded distance plus the same explicit miss policy.
Source-primitive and source-vertex bitsets restrict indexing, while
destination-owner bitsets restrict writes. Source-vertex restriction retains
triangulated regions with an explicit all-corners (default) or any-corner rule
and preserves source primitive/corner identities for sampling.
Empty source selections publish the requested miss/default policy without
attempting to build an invalid empty surface index. Discrete payloads use a
documented half-influence switch. `transfer_all` sequences explicitly requested
point, primitive, vertex, and detail patterns in one typed call; each spatial
owner builds one plan for all of its fields and owner kernels are not nested.
All transfer variants collect output attributes and replace/append them with
one expected-linear metadata-table rebuild rather than a quadratic immutable
rebuild per field.

`Attribute_ops.blur_points` reuses the cached `Topology_index` point-edge CSR
for one or many matching point-owned floating planes, including canonical
position. Uniform and inverse-original-edge-length modes preserve stable edge
order; coincident neighbors take exclusive precedence rather than introducing
an arbitrary scale epsilon. Iterations use two exact packed plane sets and one
parallel point-range launch per pass. Receiver weights, clamped neighbor alpha,
selection, and border pins are read-only controls. Position changes invalidate
stale point/vertex normals before selected output attributes are reinstalled.
The kernel rejects non-finite source, control, step, blend, and output values
atomically.

`Ops.smooth` is the geometry-facing policy layer over that same numeric
kernel. An optional primitive group is converted to referenced points directly
from the cached point-corner CSR. Free, unshared-edge, and selected-group-
boundary modes compile one packed update bitset; an optional constrained point
group is subtracted in the same pass. Group boundaries classify each incident
topology edge from its packed corner-to-primitive incidence, so no element
lists or per-point allocations enter the hot path. Existing normals are
recomputed after a position change unless point `N` was explicitly among the
smoothed fields; otherwise stale point/vertex normals are removed by the blur
kernel. Selection preparation is O(points + vertices), each numeric pass is
O(attribute components * (points + edges)), and live numeric scratch is two
exact point planes per component plus the cached topology index and at most one
point-membership bitset.

`Attribute_ops.randomize` creates or modifies floating scalar and tuple
payloads on every owner, including canonical point `P`, and weighted-discrete
text payloads. Distribution
parameters are validated and unpacked once. Each selected element/component
uses `Rand.float_at` with an immediate integer identity derived from the
immutable global generator, integer seed attribute or stable element number,
and component number. The indexed sampler performs no hot-loop boxing and
disjoint ranges write exact preallocated planes, so scheduling cannot alter
values or order. Tuple-valued two-choice sampling makes one choice per element,
not an independent choice per component. Unit direction and quaternion modes
use uniform spherical-cap mappings; interior-sphere modes use the same optional
axis/cone restriction and the exact dimension-dependent radial power for
uniform volume. The SideFX-compatible bias transform can favor either the axis
or cone boundary without rejection sampling. Inverse-CDF ramps and
weighted discrete tuples compile once into packed knots or cumulative weights.
Multidimensional Cauchy uses one shared scale and a multivariate Student-t
degree-one construction, so its direction is rotationally symmetric instead
of applying unrelated scalar Cauchy samples per axis. Component limits clamp
raw samples before global scale and the arithmetic operation; exact fraction
endpoints can therefore represent bounded distribution tails. Weighted text
choices share immutable choice strings and allocate only the required owner
pointer plane. Typed point, vertex, primitive, and native-edge selections
promote incident membership through `Element_selection`; direct corner scans
and the lightweight point-incidence index cover ordinary sources, while only
native-edge sources require the full half-edge index.
An owner-matched fraction attribute replaces indexed randomness with explicit
quantiles, including a monotone inverse-normal approximation and the correct
dimension-minus-one direction parameterization. Range workers reuse one
four-float scratch array, independent of element count. Position changes
invalidate normals.

`Attribute_ops.remap` maps floating scalar/tuple components in place or into a
new same-width payload. Explicit input ranges are constant-time setup;
automatic ranges use range-local packed minima/maxima followed by a stable
component/range reduction. Clamp and cycle modes can shape normalized values
through a validated piecewise-linear ramp; extrapolation remains linear. Empty
selections leave an existing destination unchanged or a new destination at its
zero default. Both operations are O(elements * components), allocate only
exact output planes plus O(chunks * components) reduction/error state, poll
cancellation, reject non-finite published output, and preserve unrelated
geometry by identity.

`Ops.normals`, `Ops.peak`, `Ops.bend`, and `Ops.mountain` share one deformation
core. `Ops.point_jitter` uses the same packed position replacement and normal
invalidation contract with a specialized indexed-random fill.
Normal generation preserves the source topology and computes one packed
area-vector per polygon followed by stable corner-order accumulation into
points; polygon curves and isolated points receive zero normals. Peak resolves
direction from a custom point float3 attribute, point `N`, averaged vertex
`N`, or geometric normals in that order. Its point/vertex/primitive/native-edge
selection is compiled once to affected points, and an optional point-float
mask scales signed distance without hidden clamping. Bend builds a robust
orthonormal frame from capture origin/direction/up, then applies axial twist
and an arc-length-preserving bend over a finite or unbounded interval. It
supports bidirectional capture, mirrored or continuous twist, typed component
selection, a clamped point-float mask, and optional capture-influence output.
Stable sinc/cosc expansions keep tiny bends finite without a zero-angle
branch. Mountain adds seeded 3D
Perlin fBm with per-axis frequency/offset, bounded octave controls, and an
optional signed-height attribute. Each worker range owns four reusable fBm
scalars, so sampling allocates nothing per point or octave. Position changes
remove stale point/vertex normals unless full point-normal recomputation is
requested. Face-vector, normalization, noise, and output ranges parallelize;
shared-point corner accumulation remains stable and sequential so domain
scheduling cannot perturb floating-point sums. All four operators preserve
unrelated attributes, groups, and topology by identity.

Point Jitter adds independent uniform component samples in `[-0.5, 0.5)`
scaled by an overall factor, per-axis factors, an optional point-float mask,
and optional point `pscale`. A named integer ID makes the stream stable across
point renumbering; a missing named ID deliberately falls back to point number.
The kernel copies the three position planes once, validates and fills disjoint
ranges, returns the input snapshot by identity when no position changes, and
removes stale point/vertex `N` after a change. It is O(points) time with three
exact output planes and O(ceil(points / grain)) diagnostic state, and is
byte-identical across domain counts.

`Ops.edge_divide` inserts `divisions - 1` equal-parametric points into every
selected topology edge. With shared points enabled, one ordered chain is
allocated for each selected unique edge and reused by all incident polygons or
polygon curves, including non-manifold incidence. With sharing disabled, each
primitive-edge incidence owns a private chain. Original points remain a stable
prefix, primitive count and kinds are unchanged, and each primitive's corner
order is expanded in place. Numeric point and vertex fields interpolate
linearly; integer, text, and ragged fields use the nearest stable endpoint.
Ordinary groups use endpoint intersection for inserted elements, ordered group
ancestry is remapped explicitly, and every native edge group maps to the exact
child segments of its source edges. Empty selection and one division preserve
the input by physical identity.

The cardinality-first planner computes point, vertex, and per-primitive output
ranges before allocation. Planning and disjoint position, topology, payload,
and ancestry fills use the reusable domain pool; target reverse-topology
construction remains the main sequential phase. Time is O(points + vertices +
primitives + edges + inserted points + inserted vertices), and auxiliary/output
storage is linear in those same packed cardinalities. The public edge-group
selection is topology-affine and therefore selects all coincident incidences by
construction. Connecting inserted points across faces requires an ordered cut
path and is deliberately left to a separate future split operation instead of
inventing order on an unordered native edge group.

`Ops.edge_collapse` builds deterministic disjoint-set components from selected
topology edges, optionally rejecting unions across exact point-attribute value
boundaries. Each component is materialized directly as the packed cluster
layout consumed by the existing Fuse reducer; it does not route known links
through a spatial search, add a temporary field, or maintain a second payload
reduction implementation. Unique component points move to their arithmetic
center, and stable lowest-point ancestry supplies ordinary point payload and
group values. Fuse performs point compaction, topology rewiring, every other
attribute/group remap, and topology-affine edge ancestry. Its cleanup removes
collapsed consecutive corners and under-cardinality polygons/curves by
default. Position changes always remove stale point/vertex `N`; an existing
point `N` is optionally rebuilt, while inputs without one remain without one.

Selected-edge classification and deterministic union/find are
O(edges × α(points)); packed cluster materialization is O(points), and reduction/cleanup is
linear in input plus output payload. Union/find remains sequential because
selected edges share parents, while independent attribute, topology, cleanup,
normal, and output ranges use the process-wide domain pool. Temporary storage
is O(points + edges), cache lifetime remains bounded by immutable topology and
session ownership, and one/four-domain output is byte-identical.

`Ops.poly_reduce` is the adaptive surface-reduction owner above Edge Collapse.
It first routes every non-triangle polygon through the existing robust
Triangulate kernel, then repeatedly builds normalized face-plane quadrics and
scores topology edges at their midpoint or stable lower-numbered endpoint.
Hard points, hard-edge endpoints, non-manifold neighborhoods,
selected/unselected interfaces, and optionally every unshared-boundary point
are excluded. Candidate contractions must satisfy the triangle-mesh link
condition and preserve every surviving incident triangle without collapse,
winding reversal, or an optional excessive normal deviation.

Stable `(cost, edge number)` ordering chooses one-ring-independent batches, so
committed contractions cannot interfere. Each batch is passed to
`Ops.edge_collapse`; the reducer therefore does not duplicate topology cleanup,
attribute/group policy, or topology-affine native-edge remapping. Point and
face quadrics, costs, incidence, lock planes, and validation stamps are packed
and reused across shrinking rounds. Face/quadrics/cost setup is parallel over
disjoint ranges; deterministic ordering and conflict selection stay
sequential. A constrained mesh may stop above its requested ratio or absolute
polygon count rather than violating topology.

For `r` adaptive rounds the worst-case time is
O(r × (points + primitives + edges log edges + payload)) and live scratch is
O(points + primitives + edges), in addition to current/next immutable packed
snapshots and cached reverse topology. Output ordering, positions, every
payload plane, and group membership are exact across domain counts.

`Ops.poly_bevel` is the packed polygon-fillet owner. It accepts topology-affine
edges but operates only on oppositely wound two-sided polygon incidences;
boundary, non-manifold, self, curve, inconsistent, and optionally flat edges
are excluded before topology planning. Every touched face corner receives a
cutback point. Unselected ring edges insert the opposite face's slide point,
so a partial edge selection remains watertight rather than leaving T-junctions.
Equal continuation profiles share point identities, while path and cyclic
selected-edge fans emit deterministic corner boundaries only where a surface
gap remains.

Chamfer rows use linear cross-profile interpolation. Round rows use a rational
quadratic circular arc when the two cutbacks form the equal-radius tangent
case; convexity blends that arc through a flat profile to its inward mirror.
Point-float scaling, local adjacent-front collision limits, flatness exclusion,
and named edge/corner/offset output groups are explicit policy. Numeric vertex
payload interpolates across rows; discrete payload, ordinary/ordered groups,
primitive ancestry, and source native-edge membership follow stable maps.
Stale point/vertex normals are removed and an existing point normal can be
rebuilt.

Planning is O(points + vertices + primitives + edges), plus exact output-sized
fills. It uses the shared lightweight `Topology_edge_lookup` for output edge
ancestry instead of retaining a full reverse CSR index. Combinatorial fan and
collision decisions stay stable and sequential; point/profile, base-face,
attribute, group, normal, and packed edge-bit ranges use the reusable domain
pool. One- and four-domain output is byte-identical.

`Ops.point_generate` is the packed owner for point-cloud emission. Total mode
creates an origin cloud without source ancestry. Per-point mode computes a
non-negative expected count from a constant and optional point-float scale,
then uses integer count plus deterministic source-keyed stochastic rounding of
the fractional remainder. Probability mode validates a point-float field in
`[0,1]` and emits zero or one point from the same immutable random stream.
Named point-group selection is resolved before planning; output order is always
source-point then local generated index and does not depend on scheduling.

The kernel computes every source count and a checked prefix cardinality before
allocating output. Generated positions and all selected Float, Int, Text,
Float2/3/4, Int-array, and Float-array point fields follow a single
target-to-source map; detail fields use an independent ordered glob pattern.
`sourcepoint` and `sourceindex` are integer fields with caller-selectable names,
and an optional point group marks exactly the generated suffix. When input is
retained, original points are a stable prefix, unmatched generated attribute
rows receive typed zero/empty defaults, ordered point groups preserve their
order, and generated membership is appended if the output group aliases one.
Polygon/curve vertex-point, primitive-offset, and primitive-kind planes are
structurally shared while the point domain is extended. Topology-affine native
edge bits are rebound only after verifying that those planes are shared.

Planning and fixed-width fills are O(input points + output points + copied
payload). Ragged copies add O(total copied row values). Auxiliary storage is
O(input points + output points), excluding required output payload. Count and
mapping ranges use the reusable domain pool and write disjoint slices. Once a
no-prefix map has served all payload copies, its owned buffers become the
public provenance fields directly instead of being copied. Range, finite,
storage, name, pattern, overflow, cardinality, affinity, and cancellation
failures are atomic. Complete one-/four-domain geometry and framebuffer output
are exact.

`Ops.point_replicate` consumes that exact emission plan instead of maintaining
a second cardinality or payload kernel. For every source point, a four-point
origin/+X/+Y/+Z basis passes once through the authoritative Copy-to-Points
operator. The resulting affine basis therefore inherits the same `pscale`,
float3 `scale`, quaternion `orient`, `N`/`v` plus `up`, post-`rot`, `pivot`,
`trans`, and fixed-row affine `transform` validation and composition rules.
Generated local positions then evaluate that borrowed frame directly. This
keeps transform behavior centralized even for matrix, pivot, and degenerate-up
edge cases.

The zero-dimensional point preset places every generated point at the local
center. An optional compiled attribute pattern applies the borrowed linear
frame to matching copied point Float3 values. `P` is excluded because positions
already traverse the frame exactly once. Ordinary vectors use the linear 3x3
part; `N` uses a scale-normalized inverse transpose and unit normalization.
Velocity synthesis precedes this optional compatibility pass, so explicitly
matching `v` transforms the final inherited/radial velocity like any other
vector. If any selected source that emits points has a singular frame, the
complete `N` attribute is removed atomically, matching Copy-to-Points normal
policy (including a retained prefix because an attribute cannot exist for only
one point-domain suffix). Other retained input-prefix values are never
transformed. Malformed patterns and non-finite transformed payload fail without
exposing partial geometry.

Built-in box, volume-uniform sphere, area-uniform disk, and line samples use
three source/local keyed immutable random coordinates. A custom point cloud is
sampled by point number and emits integer `shapeptnum` ancestry. Integer point
`id`, when present, keys fractional count rounding, random placement, and
source-specific quasi offsets, so reordering points preserves each cloud.
Quasi mode precomputes base-two/base-three radical-inverse sequences only to
the maximum per-source count and three source offset planes; no sequence work
is repeated per emitted point.

Optional velocity stretch multiplies local Z after source scale, or first
normalizes all three borrowed basis axes to ignore geometric scale. Generated
`v` combines a caller-scaled source velocity with the transformed radial
offset. Optional vector fBm perturbs local coordinates with explicit frequency,
offset, amplitude, roughness, attenuation, octave count, and seed. A point
float3 `rest` replaces source `P` only for noise coordinates, keeping the noisy
cloud attached while animated source positions move. One owned noise scratch
is reused per parallel range.

Without noise, work is O(input points + generated points + copied payload) and
auxiliary storage is O(input points + generated points), including the bounded
four-basis frame geometry. Noise adds O(generated points * turbulence) work;
quasi setup adds O(input points + maximum per-source count) values. All output
ranges are disjoint. Cancellation, malformed transforms/IDs/rest/velocity,
non-finite policy, invalid sizes/noise, custom-shape cardinality, overflow, and
selection errors fail atomically. One-/four-domain complete geometry and
framebuffer output are exact.

`Ops.point_split` is the packed owner for separating selected incidences of a
shared point. Point, vertex, and primitive selections map to an explicit corner
mask; native-edge selection is rejected because an edge does not identify
which incident corner owns the split. With no seam criteria, each selected
corner receives its own point. Otherwise ordered include/exclude globs select
vertex and primitive fields plus named vertex/primitive groups. Corners remain
together only when every integer, text, fixed-width numeric, ragged, and Boolean
group-membership component agrees. Float equality uses an inclusive
caller-supplied per-component tolerance; every consulted float must be finite.

Classification is point-local and deterministic. Incidences are sorted by the
complete seam tuple with the vertex number as the final tie-break, then assigned
to the first compatible stable representative. An unselected incidence keeps
the original point as the representative cluster; a selected incidence whose
tuple agrees with it does not split. Original point numbers remain a prefix and
additional clusters are appended by source-point order. Every point field and
ordinary/ordered point group duplicates through a single target-to-source
plane. Vertex, primitive, and detail slots otherwise share unchanged, and the
lightweight output-edge remapper replicates native edge membership one-to-many
without constructing a complete target reverse topology.

Optional promotion moves each matched attribute from vertex or primitive
ownership to points using the cluster representative. Unreferenced points use
the storage type's zero or empty value; groups participate in classification
but are not promoted. A matched attribute name present on both seam
owners is rejected for promotion rather than silently choosing one. The unique
mode is O(points + vertices + output payload + output edges). Seam clustering
is O(sum(degree log degree)) for exact tuples; arbitrary tolerance tuples may
compare each representative within one sorted numeric slab, so the documented
worst case is O(sum(degree * clusters * seam components)). Auxiliary storage is
O(points + vertices + output edges) plus output payload. Point-local planning,
payload duplication, promotion, and edge-group fills use stable disjoint ranges
from the reusable pool, and one-/four-domain output is byte-identical.

`Ops.dissolve` removes selected polygon edges and merges their oppositely wound
manifold incidences into deterministic face components. It traces the remaining
directed component boundary through the shared `Topology_index` rather than
constructing a second half-edge representation. A disk component emits one
polygon. Multiple closed loops may remain disjoint, be deleted, or be connected
through selected source bridge edges with explicit repeated endpoints. A
selected surface-boundary edge deletes its component by default or emits the
remaining open/closed boundary runs as polygon curves. Polygon-curve edges are
deliberately ignored.

Optional inline cleanup uses a linked queue over only selected-edge endpoints,
keeps polygon/curve minimum cardinality, and compares scale-normalized segment
directions against an explicit radian tolerance. Stable source-corner and
lowest-source-primitive ancestry drive the shared `Topology_remap` layer;
point/detail storage is shared until optional unused-point compaction, while
ordinary ordered groups and endpoint-affine native edge groups are remapped
exactly. Existing normals can be rebuilt, but the operation does not invent an
`N` field. Non-manifold selections, inconsistent winding, branching boundaries,
foreign groups, and non-finite policy fail atomically.

The common disk/boundary path is O(points + vertices + primitives + edges +
output) time and storage. The uncommon bridged multi-loop policy scans selected
edges once per joined loop; current bridging requires a selected source edge
between loops. Dense selections start with bounded geometric-growth output
buffers instead of reserving source-sized output. Combinatorial planning and
union/find are sequential for stable topology decisions; packed payload/group
remaps and normal fills use deterministic disjoint domain ranges.

`Ops.edge_flip` rotates a selected edge shared by exactly two oppositely
oriented polygon primitives around their joined boundary. A cycle advances the
first diagonal endpoint by one boundary point while preserving each incident
face's cardinality; this definition applies unchanged to triangles, quads, and
mixed N-gons. Vertex fields and groups cycle relative to the selected source
corners by default, while point/primitive/detail payload shares unchanged.
Every unchanged point-pair edge retains its native-edge ancestry and the new
diagonal inherits the replaced edge's memberships. Stale point/vertex normals
are removed, with optional rebuilding only when point `N` existed.

Planning rejects boundary/non-manifold edges, inconsistent winding, repeated
joined-boundary points, duplicate or zero-length replacement diagonals,
invalid resulting polygons, and selected pairs sharing a primitive. The last
restriction makes otherwise order-dependent edits explicit as successive SOPs.
Planning is O(edges + selected boundary vertices); topology/payload work is
linear in the geometry. Pairwise-disjoint topology fills, polygon validation,
and payload remaps use stable ranges in the reusable domain pool, with exact
one/four-domain results and bounded scratch per validation block.

`Ops.edge_cusp` interprets a native edge group as paths and splits point fans
only where a point is incident to at least two selected edges. Thus a single
edge preserves physical snapshot identity, two connected edges unique only
their shared point, and a closed loop splits every loop vertex. Effective
non-manifold edges and non-polygon incidences fail explicitly. Boundary edges
may participate in a path but introduce no fictitious opposite face.

Edge Cusp and Facet's dihedral Cusp Polygons stage share
`Facet.split_points_on_edge_ends`; PDK does not maintain two fan-partitioning
kernels. The splitter preserves unaffected point-touching components, copies
all point storage and ordinary/ordered point groups by stable source ancestry,
keeps vertex/primitive/detail slots except the normal API's documented
same-name-owner replacement, and maps every resulting edge from a source
corner. Existing point `N` is rebuilt by default and no normal is invented.
Planning is O(points + vertices + edges) time/storage; packed output
and payload fills are parallel and byte-identical across domain counts.

`Ops.edge_straighten` builds connected components from the selected native
edges and orthogonally projects each component's points onto its least-squares
best-fit line. Omitted selection means all topology edges. Components with one
edge and already-collinear components return exact source coordinates; cycles
and branches use the same fit and require no arbitrary path traversal.
Topology, attributes, and ordinary groups share structurally, an optional
native output group records the selection, and changed positions invalidate
point/vertex `N`.

Each covariance is accumulated in stable ascending point order after
scale-normalizing coordinates. Three deterministic power iterations seeded by
the coordinate basis prevent an orthogonal seed from locking onto a
subdominant eigenvector; the candidate with greatest Rayleigh quotient wins,
with stable X/Y/Z ties. Component fits are batched across the reusable domain
pool and point projections write disjoint output slots. Time and temporary
storage are O(points + edges), selected/output positions are finite-checked,
and one/four-domain geometry is byte-identical.

### Circle from Edges

`Ops.circle_from_edges` finds connected components in an explicit native edge
group, or in the topology boundary when the group is omitted. Every effective
component must be a simple degree-two loop or degree-one-ended path with at
least three unique points. Branches, collinear components, self edges, stale
topology affinity, non-finite selected endpoints, and unstable or
unrepresentable fits fail before an immutable output is committed.

Each component first normalizes its coordinates by the greatest finite
absolute component. A stable point-order covariance and the analytic symmetric
3x3 eigensystem produce the least-variance fitting plane; a deterministic
orthonormal basis then reduces the points to 2D. PDK solves the algebraic
least-squares circle center and uses the compensated mean radial distance as
the fitted radius, unless an explicit positive world-space radius is supplied.
Projection returns points to the fitting plane and applies the optional
component-wise world-axis scale about the fitted center.

Topology, all non-normal payload, groups, and unselected coordinates retain
their original ordering and ancestry. Changed output removes stale point and
vertex `N`, while an optional native edge group records exactly the processed
selection. Stable union-find and component CSR construction are O(points +
edges) time/storage. Independent fits and disjoint point projection use the
reusable domain pool; scalar eigensystem helpers avoid tuple results, and a
compare-and-set minimum makes the first-error diagnostic scheduling-independent.
Direct, SOP, scale, malformed,
cancellation, and headless framebuffer tests compare one and four domains
exactly.

### Graph Color

`Ops.graph_color` writes a non-negative integer point or primitive attribute so
no two directly connected selected elements share a value. Point connectivity
treats the referenced points of each primitive as a clique. Primitive
connectivity either joins every pair incident to a common point or only polygon
faces incident to a common topology edge; closed/open polygon curves do not
enter polygon-edge adjacency. Typed point, vertex, primitive, or native-edge
selections promote through the shared `Element_selection` core, and unselected
elements receive `-1`.

Stable union-find discovers selected connected components without materializing
clique adjacency. Each component is colored greedily in ascending element order
by rescanning packed point/corner/edge incidence, so adjacency memory remains
O(points + vertices + primitives + edges) even for high valence. Disconnected
components write disjoint color/mark ranges through the reusable domain pool;
the dependency-ordered greedy loop inside one component remains serial. This
preserves exact one/four-domain colors and avoids implying parallel speedup for
a single connected mesh.

Optional stable owner sorting delegates every topology, payload, and group
remap to the authoritative Sort kernel. Unselected elements sort first, followed
by ascending-color blocks. Requested detail integer-array begin/length fields
describe those selected worksets exactly. Existing output storage, group
affinity/cardinality, names, grain, cancellation, empty geometry, connectivity
conflicts, sorted payload ancestry, SOP cache identity, million-element scale,
and headless framebuffer equality are covered directly.

### Measure Curvature

`Ops.measure_curvature` estimates point curvature on consistently wound,
polygon-only two-manifold topology without changing topology or positions. The
shared `Topology_index.Private.polygon_manifold_boundary_points` validator
checks edge incidence, winding, boundary degree, and disconnected point fans,
so curvature, repair, and future PolyDoctor-style operations do not grow
competing incidence kernels.

The metric kernel first uniformly normalizes all finite coordinates, then
triangulates each polygon through the stable concave-safe
`Polygon_triangulation` path. A triangle/local-order CSR supplies each point's
incident triangles. Mixed Voronoi areas and cotangent Laplace vectors estimate
signed mean curvature; angle defect estimates Gaussian curvature. The mean sign
uses the consistently wound area normal. Principal values are
`H +/- sqrt(max(0, H^2 - K))`; curvedness and shape index are derived only when
requested. Global normalization is reversed analytically, which keeps extreme
finite scales and large translations from overflowing intermediate products.

Boundary points either receive zero curvature or a one-sided `pi` angle defect.
Optional synchronous neighbor smoothing operates on the fundamental mean and
Gaussian fields with pinned zero-policy boundaries. A named point group limits
which output slots are replaced while estimation remains topology-complete;
existing point-float values outside the group remain bit-identical. Output
names are distinct and optional, so a mean-only cook avoids Gaussian and
derived-field arithmetic. Malformed topology, non-finite positions, field
collisions, cancellation, and invalid policies fail atomically.

Construction is O(points + vertices + primitives + internal triangles) time
and auxiliary storage. Each smoothing step is O(edges); requested fields add
O(points) storage. Exact-sized triangle/CSR/field planes and stable index ranges
allow the reusable Domainslib pool to write disjoint slots. Direct PDK and SOP
tests compare every requested float plane exactly between one and four domains;
the headless regression also compares byte-identical PNGs. Analytic sphere,
saddle, flat-boundary, winding, scaling through `1e-150` and `1e150`, large
translation, selection-preservation, smoothing, malformed-fan, and cancellation
cases cover the numerical contract.

The release benchmark command is:

```sh
dune build --profile release tools/bench_curvature.exe
PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 PRISMEL_CURVATURE_POINTS=1000000 \
  PRISMEL_CURVATURE_REPEATS=3 _build/default/tools/bench_curvature.exe
PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4 PRISMEL_CURVATURE_POINTS=1000000 \
  PRISMEL_CURVATURE_REPEATS=3 _build/default/tools/bench_curvature.exe
```

On the repository benchmark host with OCaml 5.3.0 release profile, a torus with
1,000,000 points, 1,000,000 quads, and 2,000,000 internal triangles produced:

| Workload | 1 domain | 4 domains | Wall reduction | Exact hash |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mean only | 0.471 s | 0.300 s | 36.3% | `-5046078577941067272` |
| Six fields, two smoothing steps | 0.643 s | 0.354 s | 45.0% | `8793907604084536345` |

Median calling-domain allocations were respectively 681/434 MB and 897/548
MB; that counter excludes worker-domain minor allocations. Measured major
allocation was about 329 MB for mean and 401 MB for the smoothed six-field
case. A cold one-repeat four-domain process running both workloads peaked at
896,228 KiB RSS. These are baselines for further scratch/CSR compaction, not a
claim of zero allocation.

### Attribute Laplacian

`Ops.attribute_laplacian` applies a discrete surface Laplacian to point-owned
float, integer, float2, float3, or float4 fields; canonical `P` is a read-only
float3 source. It writes a same-width floating field and never changes topology,
positions, or unrelated payload. A point group restricts output replacement,
while source values needed by selected one-rings remain visible. Compatible
existing values outside the group are copied exactly.

Signed cotangent mode uses the stable polygon triangulation, triangle/local
incidence CSR, cotangents, and Meyer mixed areas from the same packed
`Surface_metric` core as Measure Curvature. Positive-cotangent mode clamps each
negative triangle contribution before reduction. This gives non-negative
neighbor influence but deliberately trades away signed cotangent linear
precision on obtuse meshes, reflecting the known incompatible properties of
discrete Laplace operators rather than hiding the policy behind a tolerance.
Uniform mode traverses unique topology edges directly through
`Topology_index` and does not pay for metric triangulation.

The sign convention is `neighbor - center`, so adding a sufficiently small
positive multiple smooths the source and subtraction sharpens it. Pointwise
cotangent output divides the half-weighted sum by world-space mixed area;
integrated output retains the weighted sum. Uniform pointwise output is the
neighbor average difference, while integrated output is the unnormalized
valence sum. Empty/isolated points produce zero. All modes require a polygon-
only consistently wound two-manifold; metric modes additionally reject
non-finite positions and degenerate or unrepresentable stable triangulations.
Source/output storage, cardinality, names, selection affinity, cancellation,
and every computed value are validated before the immutable output is exposed.

Time is O(points + vertices + primitives + internal triangles + source-width *
incidence) and auxiliary storage is linear. The component traversal computes
each edge/triangle weight once per point instead of rescanning incidence for
each tuple component. All point, metric, validation, and output ranges are
disjoint and deterministic; exact one/four-domain PDK/SOP fields and
byte-identical headless framebuffers cover signed, positive, and uniform modes.
Constant null-space, planar linear precision, the octahedron
`delta P = -2 H n` identity from scales `1e-150` through `1e150`,
scalar/tuple/integer storage, point groups,
malformed topology, and cancellation are direct regressions. Extracting the
shared metric retained the previous curvature hashes and improved the measured
million-point curvature medians, so reuse introduced no fidelity or performance
regression.

The release benchmark command is:

```sh
dune build --profile release tools/bench_laplacian.exe
PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 PRISMEL_LAPLACIAN_POINTS=1000000 \
  PRISMEL_LAPLACIAN_REPEATS=3 _build/default/tools/bench_laplacian.exe

```

On the same OCaml 5.3.0 release-profile host, a 1,000,000-point,
1,000,000-quad torus with a float3 `P` source produced:

| Workload | 1 domain | 4 domains | Wall reduction | Exact hash |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pointwise signed cotangent | 0.471 s | 0.280 s | 40.6% | `-8996758845128957858` |
| Pointwise positive cotangent | 0.475 s | 0.281 s | 40.8% | `7819334971099552542` |
| Uniform neighbor average | 0.165 s | 0.132 s | 19.8% | `6174720405700189381` |

Median calling-domain allocation was 625/391 MB for signed and positive
cotangent, and 73/73 MB for uniform one/four-domain
runs; worker-domain minor allocation is not included in that counter. Major
allocation was about 289 MB for metric modes and 73 MB for uniform. A cold
four-domain process running all three cases once peaked at 826,196 KiB RSS.
Replacing polymorphic float `max` in the positive-cotangent incidence loop
removed 48 MB of measured allocation at 250,000 points without changing its
hash.

### Triangulate 2D

`Ops.triangulate_2d` is the first public adapter over the shared packed
`Delaunay2` core. It accepts a typed point selection and projects source points
through PCA best fit, XY/YZ/ZX, an explicit origin/normal frame, or a point
float2/float3 attribute. Triangles continue to reference the original point
numbers and therefore restore the authored 3D positions without a reverse
metric mapping. Exact projected duplicates use the lowest selected source
point. Optional duplicate removal deletes only the non-representative selected
points after topology and groups are finalized; it uses the shared stable
Deletion remap, so unrelated unused or unselected points and their payload
remain intact. Point/detail payload and point groups are shared by default; topology-
dependent payload and stale normals are removed.

Ignore Non-Constraint Points mode first derives the complete exact constraint
set and uses only its source endpoints in stable source order. Explicit native
edge and primitive constraints are prefiltered before projection and Delaunay
construction; silhouette mode retains the full orientation pass, then rebuilds
from the exact derived boundary. Other selected source points remain in the
immutable point payload but are isolated from output topology; a separate
Remove Unused Points policy may compact them. The reduced seed and
endpoint remap use exact-sized packed arrays and disjoint stable fills.
Requesting this mode without any constraint is an explicit error rather than
silently producing an empty mesh.

After topology and output groups are finalized, optional Remove Unused Points
uses the shared stable packed compaction kernel, preserving exact fixed/ragged
payload and group ancestry. Optional Recompute Point Normals invokes the shared
Normals kernel only when the input already contained point `N`; it does not
invent a normal schema for inputs that did not request one. Both controls are
part of immutable SOP identity rather than hidden post-cook mutation.

The core uses packed counter-clockwise triangle/neighbor planes, adjacency
walking, local Bowyer-Watson cavities, and recycled triangle slots. Filtered
orientation and incircle tests fall back to exact dyadic signs whenever a
binary64 decision is ambiguous, underflows, or overflows. Ordinary ranges use
a finite power-of-two supertriangle; extreme finite inputs use exact
homogeneous coordinates, so no finite world-space bound is assumed. Seeded
insertion only shuffles fixed spatial blocks and never reads global random
state. Projection and output point-number fills use stable disjoint ranges;
the dependency-ordered topology insertion remains serial.

Native-edge and primitive-perimeter constraints first enter the shared
`Planar_constraints` arrangement. A packed median BVH filters segment pairs;
exact orientation signs classify proper crossings, endpoint-on-segment
junctions, and collinear overlaps. Proper crossings are rejected unless the
explicit splitting policy is enabled. When enabled, exact homogeneous
line-line constructions are deduplicated before deterministic atomic segments
are emitted. Existing constraint endpoints split T junctions and overlaps in
either mode. Authored Delaunay representatives are queried against the same
packed segment BVH in two passes. Exact orientation decides point-on-segment
incidence; prefix-summed counts permit disjoint parallel fills and stable
output. Exact-coordinate duplicates select the lowest source point, including
when an authored point already occupies a proper crossing. Expected work is
O((segments + embedded points) log segments + incidences), with linear
auxiliary storage and unavoidable output proportional to incidences.
New points are inserted by exact containing-face or containing-
edge splits and then enter the shared `Planar_cdt` kernel. It traces the exact
sequence of triangles crossed by each atomic segment, removes that strip as one
cavity, exact-ear-clips the two boundary chains against the new segment, and
repairs only unconstrained diagonals to a stable constrained-Delaunay state.
This avoids the cycling failure of repeated arbitrary Lawson flips and
preserves triangle cardinality. A specialized integer edge table owns
incidence and constraint affinity; recovered segments can be emitted as a
topology-affine native edge group. Split points append to the original point
planes. Their 3D position and continuous point fields use the deterministically
lower-indexed source constraint; discrete/ragged fields and point groups use
its nearest endpoint. A generated-point group makes this policy inspectable.
Authored points that split a constraint retain their existing identity and are
not reported as generated.

Sequential CDT builds may borrow an exclusively owned private workspace with a
reserved point capacity and stable edge-key stride. The first build fills its
geometrically growing triangle planes, point-to-triangle seeds, and open-
addressed edge table. Passing that exact packed result back by physical
identity with a contiguous suffix of inserted point numbers continues the live
incidence directly; an empty suffix reuses it for coordinate-only Delaunay
repair. Canonical previous/current constraint arrays are merge-differenced in
linear time. Removed edges are unmarked, added edges alone are recovered and
marked, and triangle replacement reaffirms any unchanged current constraint,
so split or removed constraints cannot leave stale affinity. A copied,
discontinuous, over-capacity, clipped, or winding-filtered snapshot takes the
audited full-rebuild path.

Every returned public value owns a separate packed triangle array. A failed or
cancelled continuation invalidates only its scratch session, cannot mutate an
earlier result, and permits a later full rebuild in the same workspace.
Successful full/incremental counters expose the path to focused diagnostics.
Final canonical ordering writes one packed array and applies the sorted
permutation in place by disjoint permutation cycles instead of allocating a
second packed triangle array. Standalone calls retain the same result ownership
and ordering without requiring a workspace.

Optional quality refinement operates on that already clipped constrained-
Delaunay mesh rather than reconstructing the original convex hull. Each stable
generation classifies bad triangles by minimum angle, maximum area, or target
edge length. It proposes a scale-normalized binary64 circumcenter and accepts
that construction only after exact orientation predicates certify it inside
the retained parent triangle; a rounded centroid is the bounded fallback.
Predicates remain exact for every accepted binary64 construction. An
encroached constraint is split at its exact homogeneous midpoint when
constraint splitting is enabled. All accepted points are exact-deduplicated,
constraints are re-atomized in stable order, and the new batch is inserted
into the current clipped CDT. Consequently refinement cannot resurrect a
previously removed exterior region.

The point budget includes arrangement crossings as well as refinement points;
an arrangement that already exceeds the requested budget fails before a
partial result is committed. Reaching the interior refinement budget returns
the best completed generation and records the limit rather than exceeding the
bound. Minimum angle is in radians and must be below pi/3. Minimum edge length
suppresses further work on a bad triangle whose longest edge is smaller than
the threshold. Generated positions and continuous point payload use stored
parent barycentric weights recursively; exact constraint midpoints use equal
endpoint weights. Discrete, ragged, and group payload select a stable parent
representative. Split-point and refinement-point output groups remain
distinct.

Triangle classification and candidate construction fill disjoint arrays in
parallel; the classification predicate returns one immediate boolean rather
than allocating a float tuple per triangle. Refinement and regularization
share one private CDT workspace across their sequential generations. CDT
recovery remains dependency-ordered and serial. Contiguous generations retain
triangle incidence and insert only their new point suffix; coordinate-only
regularization retains the same incidence. Every generation still scans the
complete edge table to seed Delaunay legalization and emits a globally sorted
canonical snapshot; only the constraint delta is replayed. For one
generation, classification is O(T), CDT update has the documented
`Planar_cdt` expected cost, and a shared packed bounds index makes constraint
encroachment and re-atomization expected O(S log S + (Q+B) log S + I), for Q
quality candidates, B accepted points, S atomic constraints, and I conservative
broad-phase incidences. Certified implicit-coordinate intervals and an
outward-rounded L1 circle bound prevent the index from dropping an exact
candidate; exact diametral and point-on-segment predicates remain authoritative.
Packed point, triangle, constraint, provenance, index, and scratch planes
require O(P + T + S + Q + B) live storage.

An explicit non-negative Regularization Steps count runs after the final
refinement generation. Each step builds one packed unique-edge/point-incidence
index, fixes every hull and constraint point, and moves eligible generated
interior points toward the stable compensated average of their one-ring
neighbors. Allow Movement of Interior Input Points extends eligibility to
original projected interior points. Candidate coordinates are rounded
binary64 constructions, then a deterministic global backtracking factor is
halved until every moved point remains in its old star and every triangle has
strictly positive exact orientation under the simultaneous move. The shared
CDT repair restores constrained-Delaunay topology after the accepted step.

Repeated movement appends to a compact topologically ordered provenance DAG.
Generated 3D positions and numeric point payload evaluate this DAG once;
discrete, ragged, and group payload follow its stable greatest-weight source
representative. With the default restoration policy, original input positions
remain authored while their relaxed projections may affect connectivity; the
disabled policy below materializes those relaxed coordinates. One step costs
O(T log T + E + P) for its packed index and relaxation work plus CDT repair;
live relaxation scratch is O(T + E + P), and provenance grows only with
explicitly moved generated points per requested step. Centroid, construction,
containment, and orientation ranges are parallel; stable index construction, acceptance, DAG
commit, and CDT repair remain serial.

Restore Original Point Positions defaults on and evaluates the same provenance
DAG against authored 3D `P`. When disabled, the adapter instead materializes
the final relaxed 2D coordinates on the selected projection plane. XY, YZ, and
ZX projection set the dropped world component to zero; an explicit plane uses
its authored origin and normal; PCA best fit uses its scale-normalized fitted
world plane. A point float2 or float3 coordinate attribute uses exactly its
first two finite components and emits `(x, y, 0)`; later float3 components are
irrelevant to both topology and output position. Participating source points,
constraint intersections, and refinement points are embedded, while isolated
source points excluded from the triangulation retain authored `P`. Every
embedded binary64 result must remain finite. The output allocates three exact-
cardinality position planes and fills disjoint local-point ranges in parallel,
so this mode adds O(output points) time and output storage without changing
topology decisions or point-payload interpolation.

Optional Keep Primitives constructs one cardinality-first output topology with
all input primitives except members of the explicit constraint-primitive group
as a stable prefix and all generated triangles as a suffix. Source curves and
polygons retain their kind, corner order, and point identities. Fixed-width and
ragged vertex/primitive attributes copy exact retained ancestry; generated
triangle entries receive the storage-kind default (numeric zero, empty text, or
empty CSR row). Ordinary and ordered groups preserve retained ancestry, while
the triangle output group selects only the suffix. Source native-edge groups
remap once by unchanged point endpoints; an explicitly named constrained-edge
output replaces a colliding source name, reusing the same target edge index.
Point/detail payload continues to use
the interpolation policy above. When duplicate removal is also enabled,
retained corners and native edges are first rewired to the stable projected-
coordinate representative, so compacting an otherwise referenced duplicate
cannot destroy a kept primitive. Planning and packed fills are O(source
primitives + source vertices + output triangles + retained payload), with
O(source primitives + output topology + retained payload) auxiliary/output
storage; primitive and corner fills write disjoint stable ranges in parallel.

Optional hull-boundary outside removal seeds every triangle incident to an
unconstrained convex-hull edge and performs one packed breadth-first flood
through unconstrained adjacency. Constrained edges are exact barriers. The
result compacts retained triangles and constrained-edge metadata in stable
order. Cavity retriangulation also detects vertices interior to a traced strip
and deterministically reinserts them, preventing a valid non-hull constraint
from silently dropping authored points.

Constraint-polygon outside removal carries signed directed winding through
every split atomic segment. Duplicate and overlapping segments aggregate their
signed multiplicity. Starting from exact hull-side values, one packed dual
breadth-first traversal propagates winding across every triangle edge; no
rounded centroid or ray test decides membership. Non-zero regions remain.
Consequently disjoint loops form a union, overlapping same-oriented loops stay
filled, same-oriented nesting remains filled, opposite-oriented nesting forms
a hole, and coincident opposite loops cancel. Edge-group and open-curve
constraints carry zero winding and therefore remain barriers without inventing
polygon interiors.

Projected-silhouette mode classifies every selected polygon with the exact
packed area sign. It chooses one global facing orientation, cancels directed
incidence across same-facing internal edges, and retains boundary or
opposite-facing edges as the silhouette. Reversing every source face therefore
does not change the result. Face classification and per-topology-edge winding
write disjoint stable ranges through the shared domain pool; validation and
constraint emission remain serial so errors and edge order are deterministic.
Partially selected polygons are rejected, while zero-area projected faces do
not invent an interior.

With OCaml 5.3.0, Dune 3.24.0's default development profile, grain 16,384,
and the four-core Linux 6.8/aarch64 runner used by the surrounding PDK table,
100,000 deterministic points produced 199,918 triangles in a 0.949-second
median with 65.7 MB current-domain allocation and 1,648 promoted bytes (three
repetitions, one domain).
That allocation figure is the current optimization baseline, not a production
claim. The exact undocumented SideFX numerical regularization profile remains
an explicit parity gate before this node can move out of Partial status.

On the same 100,000-point source whose existing 199,918 triangles carry one
vertex float and one primitive integer field, Keep Primitives produced a stable
399,836-face result in a 1.008-second median with 130.86 MB current-domain
allocation, 3,096 promoted bytes, 88.38 MB major allocation, and topology hash
`2887283567451037009` on one domain. Four domains produced the identical hash
in 0.995 seconds with 121.32 MB current-domain allocation; dependency-ordered
Delaunay construction dominates this adapter workload, so no multicore speedup
is claimed.

On the same 100,000-point seed, disabling original-position restoration
materialized all projected `P` planes and 199,918 triangles in a 0.997-second
median with 94.68 MB current-domain allocation, 3,008 promoted bytes, and
55.20 MB major allocation on one domain. Four domains produced the identical
topology hash `2710672592452761305` in 0.990 seconds with 88.40 MB current-
domain allocation. Delaunay construction remains serial and dominates, so the
parallel materialization does not justify a multicore speedup claim.

On the same 100,000-point seed, recovering one legal long constraint and
repairing 199,918 triangles takes a 0.234-second median with 81.88 MB allocated,
960 promoted bytes, and stable hash `4607585910187537252`.

The exact arrangement benchmark uses two complementary workloads. 100,000
disjoint segments take a 0.0909-second median with 92.50 MB current-domain
allocation, 2,120 promoted bytes, and stable hash `521543672821096657`.
A 256-by-256 crossing grid constructs and deduplicates 65,536 exact split
points in a 0.277-second median with 155.91 MB allocated and stable hash
`331324657301745941`. Before the no-crossing fast path and linear BVH-bound
construction, the disjoint workload took 1.048 seconds, allocated 546.64 MB,
and promoted 98.42 MB on the same process configuration.

One constraint containing 100,000 authored collinear points atomizes into
99,999 edges in a five-run median of 0.135 seconds on one domain and 0.116
seconds on four domains, with stable hash `2878715107207330704`. The
one-domain path allocates 82.40 MB on the calling domain; the four-domain
calling-domain figure is 42.82 MB because worker-domain minor allocation is
not included by `Gc.allocated_bytes`. Before this path existed, the valid
input failed constraint recovery instead of producing a benchmarkable result.

The duplicate-removal adapter benchmark selects 100,000 points at four exact
projected coordinates, with distinct authored Z values. It retains the lowest
selected representative at each coordinate and compacts to four points in a
0.0258-second one-domain median and a 0.0254-second four-domain median. The
packed topology hash is `3186253908326029459` in both modes; calling-domain
allocation is 15.93 MB and 13.84 MB respectively. This is a selective deletion
baseline, not a global Remove Unused Points measurement.

The bounded quality-refinement benchmark starts from a unit square and targets
an edge length of `1.8 / sqrt(100000)`. It emits 66,049 points in a three-run
median of 1.483 seconds on one domain and 1.549 seconds on four domains, with
identical hash `3660410599853783093`. Calling-domain allocation is 1.067 GB and
757.08 MB respectively; promoted allocation is approximately 92.4 MB and major
allocation is 203.9 MB in both modes. Against the pre-workspace one-domain
implementation on the same command, reusable/incremental CDT state, in-place
canonicalization, and allocation-free classification reduced wall time by
2.6%, calling-domain allocation by 7.1%, and major allocation by 20.9%. The lack
of multicore speedup is recorded honestly: serial CDT recovery dominates
this workload, and worker-domain minor allocation is excluded from the four-
domain calling-domain figure. This remains a regression baseline, not a
production claim.

A constrained refinement scale case uses a 10,000-edge closed boundary and a
256-point budget. The former candidate-by-constraint scan took 2.778 seconds
and allocated 7.108 GB on the calling domain; the shared packed bounds index
produces the identical 10,256-point result and hash `5576516039082866` in a
three-run 0.256-second median with 192.87 MB allocated. These use the same
process configuration, a 10.8x wall-time and 36.9x allocation
improvement. Reproduce the scale with `PRISMEL_REFINEMENT_CONSTRAINTS=10000`.

The regularization benchmark refines the unit square to 8,321 points, then runs
two relaxation steps. The zero-step seed takes a 0.154-second median and
132.55 MB calling-domain allocation; the two-step cook takes 0.282 seconds and
211.52 MB on one domain. Four domains take 0.161 and 0.300 seconds respectively,
so the current serial packed-edge sort and CDT repair dominate at this size and
no speedup is claimed. One and four domains produce exact hashes
`4415231494534350957` before movement and `192142334138055436` after two steps.
These are three-repeat OCaml 5.3 development-profile baselines with
`PRISMEL_REGULARIZATION_POINTS=10000`.

A steady coordinate-repair benchmark starts from the same canonical
199,918-triangle snapshot with no inserted points or constraints. Rebuilding
incidence on every cook takes 0.228 seconds and allocates 70.48 MB on one
domain. After one unmeasured workspace warm-up, exact-snapshot continuation
takes 0.170 seconds and allocates 21.79 MB, with major allocation falling from
59.29 MB to 10.60 MB. That is 25.3% less wall time, 69.1% less calling-domain
allocation, and 82.1% less major allocation. Four domains take 0.228 and 0.171
seconds respectively with the identical topology hash
`2710672592452761305`; the kernel remains dependency-ordered, so this is
amortized state reuse rather than a parallel speedup claim.

An unblocked hull flood over the 199,918-triangle seed removes the complete
triangulation in a 0.191-second median with 72.48 MB allocated and stable empty
hash `17`. Empty polygon winding classification traverses the same seed in a
0.203-second median with 82.08 MB allocated and the same empty hash.

An explicit triangular constraint over a 100,000-point source cooks in 0.924
milliseconds on one domain and 0.991 milliseconds on four when Ignore
Non-Constraint Points is enabled. It emits one triangle with stable hash
`4798887604116780`, retains the other source points as isolated payload, and
allocates 1.83 MB on the calling domain. The corresponding unrestricted
Delaunay seed alone takes 0.949 seconds, demonstrating that endpoint
prefiltering occurs before the expensive topology construction.

The complete projected-silhouette adapter benchmark starts from the same
100,000 points and their 199,918 authored triangular faces, extracts the hull
silhouette, recovers it, and emits the unchanged triangulation. Its three-run
median is 1.416 seconds on one domain and 1.419 seconds on four domains, with
identical hash `2710672592452761305`. The corresponding allocations are
364.79 MB and 342.94 MB. The measured workload is dominated by the serial
Delaunay and topology-index stages; the four-domain result is retained as an
honest regression baseline rather than presented as a speedup. The complete
one-repeat benchmark process, including every workload in the executable,
peaks at 241,240 KiB RSS on one domain.

Reproduce the baseline with:

```sh

```

### Edge Equalize

`Ops.edge_equalize` reduces the initial selected lengths to a scale-safe
average, longest, or shortest target, then moves only points incident to the
selection. Omitted selection means every topology edge. A topology-affine
output edge group can record the exact processed set; changed snapshots share
topology and unrelated payload while removing stale point/vertex `N`.

When every selected point has degree one, each edge is independent: PDK applies
the symmetric endpoint correction in one disjoint parallel pass, preserves the
edge midpoint, and shares coordinate planes that cannot change. Connected
selections use stable point-to-edge CSR incidence and a Jacobi projection with
a common maximum-degree denominator and fixed `0.9` relaxation. The common
denominator makes paired edge corrections cancel globally, preserving the
selected system's centroid in exact arithmetic. A deterministic serial maximum
residual check controls the explicit iteration ceiling and relative tolerance,
so domain scheduling cannot change the stop iteration or result bits.

Target reduction, topology-affinity, names, finite coordinates, representable
lengths, cancellation, and convergence are validated before an immutable
output is committed. A positive target cannot expand a zero-length edge because
no direction exists; a zero shortest target may collapse other selected edges.
Planning is O(points + edges), connected solving is
O(iterations * (points + selected incidences)), and scratch is O(points +
edges). Lengths and incidence are packed arrays; iteration buffers are bounded
and become unreachable after the cook.

### Edge Relax

`Ops.edge_relax` matches source edges to an immutable reference with exactly
the same packed topology. Individual mode uses each reference edge length;
scale-independent mode rescales that distribution by the ratio of stable
selected mean lengths, preserving source scale. A point group selects movable
points directly, a primitive group promotes its incident points once, and an
optional point group pins points. Edges incident to at least one movable,
unpinned point form the constraint set. Unselected and pinned endpoints remain
fixed, while `only_shorten` suppresses every non-shrinking correction.

Disjoint constraints with stable step size use a closed-form geometric decay
for the requested iteration count. This avoids retaining six iteration planes,
supports one- or two-movable-endpoint constraints, writes edges in disjoint
parallel ranges, and shares coordinate planes that cannot move. Connected
constraints call the same `Edge_constraints.project` Jacobi kernel as Edge
Equalize. Its stable CSR incident order, common maximum-degree denominator,
disjoint point writes, and serial residual decision make one- and multi-domain
results byte-identical. Reaching the iteration ceiling returns the bounded best
effort, matching the artist-facing relaxation contract rather than smuggling
state into a later cook.

Source/reference topology, selections, pins, finite and representable lengths,
normalization, zero-length expansion, step/tolerance/iteration policy, output,
and cancellation are checked atomically. Planning is O(points + edges), solve
time is O(iterations * (points + selected incidences)) for connected inputs,
and scratch is O(points + edges). Changed output shares topology/unrelated
payload and removes stale point/vertex `N`.

### Blend Shapes

`Ops.blend_shapes` keeps the first geometry's topology and blends its canonical
point positions toward an ordered collection of immutable target shapes.
Normalized mode assigns residual weight below one to the source and divides
positive target totals above one; differencing mode accumulates weighted
`target - source` deltas and deliberately permits negative or greater-than-one
extrapolation. Targets always accumulate in descriptor order, so reusable-
domain scheduling cannot alter floating-point association.

An optional point group preserves all unselected source values. Integer or text
point IDs build validated unique target maps for reordered and partial shapes;
unmatched source IDs contribute their source value. Set/Scale masks may come
from the first input or each target, with a target-specific attribute override.
`P` and pattern-selected point Float/Float2/Float3/Float4 attributes use the
same weights; a missing target field contributes the source field. Discrete and
ragged fields remain structurally shared. Position changes remove stale vertex
normals and remove point normals unless a target point `N` was actually blended.

The hot path is target-major. Every output component is allocated once, and a
masked/ID-normalized cook retains at most one O(points) weight-sum plane plus
optional O(points) ID maps per target. Work is O(points * targets * blended
components), auxiliary storage is O(output + points * ID-mapped targets), and
point fills/validation use disjoint reusable-domain ranges. All validation,
finite-output checks, cancellation, and metadata replacement commit atomically.

### Attribute Composite

`Ops.attribute_composite` composites an ordered first geometry plus any number
of immutable weighted inputs while retaining the first geometry's topology,
groups, and unselected payload. Detail, primitive, point, and vertex attributes
have independent compiled include/exclude patterns. Canonical point `P` is
never matched implicitly: `allow_position` must be true and the point pattern
must also select `P`.

Mean divides the sum of `attribute * input_weight * alpha` by the corresponding
sum of effective weights, producing exact zero for a zero denominator. Maximum
and Minimum compare those weighted candidates component by component. Over and
Under initialize the intermediate result from the weighted first input and
then fold additional inputs in descriptor order using respectively
`source * alpha + destination * (1 - alpha)` and
`source * (1 - alpha) + destination * alpha`. A missing selected field is
numeric zero; a missing alpha field is exactly one. Alpha is a finite scalar
float on the same owner and is not silently clamped.

The packed kernel supports Float, Float2, Float3, and Float4 attributes. It
discovers their union in stable first-seen input order, rejects same-name kind
or direct-index cardinality conflicts, and allocates every output component
once. Integer, text, and ragged attributes remain structurally shared from the
first input. Input weights, operated values, alpha values, denominators, and
intermediate/final results must be finite; errors and cancellation publish no
partial geometry. Changing `P` removes point or vertex `N` unless that owner of
`N` was explicitly composited in the same atomic commit.

Time is O(elements * inputs * selected components). Output storage is exactly
one float plane per selected component; spatially varying Mean alpha adds one
denominator plane per active owner. Input-major accumulation order is stable,
while each plane pass writes disjoint element ranges through the reusable
domain pool, so one- and multi-domain results are byte-identical.

### Attribute Mirror

`Ops.attribute_mirror` copies point, vertex, or primitive attributes from a
source element to selected destination elements while retaining topology and
all unselected payload. Explicit mapping reads a same-owner integer field as a
destination-to-source index and requires a same-owner destination group. Plane
mapping robustly normalizes the plane, classifies exact-plane elements as a
seam, reflects negative-side point positions or primitive bounding-box centers,
and queries the shared packed `Spatial_index` for positive-side matches within
the finite non-negative tolerance. Plane correspondence for vertex attributes
and topology traversal are rejected rather than approximated by a second
topology kernel.

Compiled attribute patterns cover Float, Int, Text, Float2, Float3, Float4, and
packed integer/float rows. Copy is exact. UV reflection uses a normalized line;
vector reflection omits plane translation; point reflection includes it.
Vector/point transforms therefore require plane mode. Literal text replacement
is destination-only. Optional mapping output writes the source number on both
members of every pair and `-1` elsewhere; optional source and destination groups
may overlap for explicit self/cross mappings and are built deterministically.
An owner-matched restriction may describe either the source or destination
side. Explicitly selecting point `P` changes positions and invalidates stale
point/vertex normals unless the corresponding `N` field is also selected.

Explicit mapping is O(elements + copied payload) time and O(elements + output)
auxiliary storage: one integer source plane and one destination bit-plane are
the ordinary correspondence floor. Optional output maps/groups allocate only
when requested. Plane mapping adds O(elements log source-elements) index build
and nearest queries plus O(elements) packed spatial scratch. Cardinality,
owner, storage, pattern, finite-value, transform, name, tolerance, and
cancellation failures commit no partial geometry. Stable element scans and
disjoint packed writes make one- and multi-domain results byte-identical.

### Rewire Vertices

`Ops.rewire_vertices` replaces polygon/curve corner-to-point indices from a
scalar integer point, vertex, or primitive attribute. A typed point, vertex,
primitive, or native-edge restriction is first promoted to the target
attribute's owner, matching owner-dependent selection expansion. Point targets
apply to every corner referencing each selected point, vertex targets apply per
corner, and primitive targets apply to every corner of each selected primitive.
Negative and out-of-range targets leave the corresponding corner unchanged.

Recursive point mode resolves the target field as a functional graph in
O(points) time: chains end at the terminal valid point, cycle members retain
their own incidence, and a tail entering a cycle ends at its stable entry.
Target-field deletion and optional vertex integer original-point provenance
commit atomically. By default cleanup removes only points which were used by
the input and became unused because of rewiring; points already free on the
input remain present. `keep_unused_points` disables that cleanup. Point and
vertex normals are invalidated after a real topology change.

All fixed and ragged point payload plus point groups follow stable compaction;
vertex, primitive, and detail payload retain their exact corner/primitive
identity. Native edge groups follow source corner-edge ancestry. When several
source edges become one target edge, membership is their deterministic union.
The kernel preserves primitive order, corner order/count, primitive kinds, and
degenerate topology exactly rather than silently invoking a repair operation.

Direct mode is O(vertices + primitives + payload), with exact output topology
planes. Recursive resolution and default cleanup add O(points) packed scratch.
Owner/storage/cardinality/name/selection/affinity and cancellation failures
publish no partial geometry. Disjoint corner fills, point-payload compaction,
and edge-group bit materialization use the reusable domain pool; sequential
functional-graph and prefix decisions have stable numeric order.

### Edge Transport

`Ops.edge_transport` builds a deterministic shortest-path forest over selected
topology edges. First/last policy seeds every connected selected component;
an explicit point group supplies multi-source roots and leaves unreachable
points unchanged. Scale-safe edge metrics, then root number, then parent/point
number break equal-distance ties. The packed indexed heap never exposes cook
scheduling in the chosen forest.

The forward pass supports root-value Transport, Transport from Root, ancestor
Total, Maximum, and Minimum. Total can integrate an implicit constant and
scale each contribution by its outgoing tree edge; Copy or Split controls
branch fan-out. Backward traversal treats forest leaves as roots and combines
child branches by Add, Maximum, or Minimum. Independent reverse trees evaluate
through stable reusable-domain ranges. Global or per-component normalization
is applied only to reached points. Topology is structurally shared and the
scalar point attribute is installed only after all name, owner, cardinality,
finite metric/output, group, grain, and cancellation checks succeed. Planning
is O(points + edges), forest construction is O((points + edges) log points),
evaluation is O(points), and bounded auxiliary storage is O(points + edges).
Edge metric validation is parallel. First/last root policies drain independent
components through component-local heaps; explicit multi-source roots retain a
single stable heap so root/distance/point tie semantics remain global.

`Ops.edge_transport_curves` avoids that general graph machinery for selected
polygon/curve primitives. Open forward traversal starts at the lower-numbered
endpoint. Closed primitives use the lowest-numbered point as a seam and the
lower-numbered adjacent point as forward direction; backward traversal reverses
the policy. Scalar point and vertex fields support the same operations and
normalization. Selected curves fill disjoint primitive ranges through the
reusable pool. Point ownership performs a linear alias audit and rejects a
point shared by multiple selected curves; vertex ownership needs no alias
plane. Time is O(selected vertices), scratch is O(points) for multi-curve point
validation and O(1) beyond the exact output for vertex or single-curve input.
One- and multi-domain fields are byte-identical.

`Ops.edge_transport_parent` consumes an integer point parent attribute and does
not require topology edges. Invalid, self, and selected-to-unselected parent
references form roots; cycles are unreachable and preserve their input values.
Stable numeric root and child order defines a packed child CSR. Forward
Copy/Split and backward Add/Maximum/Minimum use the same scalar evaluator as
the edge-network method, while independent trees cook in parallel. Common
already ordered forward forests stream directly from the borrowed parent plane
and allocate only the exact output field. General planning, evaluation, and
normalization are O(points) time and O(points) bounded scratch.

Convex Hull promotes an optional point, vertex, primitive, or native-edge
selection once to a packed point mask and removes only bit-identical finite
positions before topology work. Exact 2D/3D orientation predicates decide
affine dimension, face visibility, and every horizon edge. One unique point
remains free; a collinear set becomes an endpoint open polygon curve; a
coplanar set uses a stable exact-orientation monotone chain and becomes one
polygon; a full-dimensional set uses deterministic conflict-graph Quickhull
and becomes an outward closed triangle surface. Approximate normalized signed
volume participates only in choosing a legal pivot from an already exactly
classified outside set and therefore cannot change inclusion or topology.

Output points retain ascending source-point ancestry. Point fields and point
groups follow that exact map, detail fields remain shared, and stale point
`N`, corner/primitive payload, and topology-affine edge groups are removed.
Optional source-number and all-face group outputs are materialized atomically.
Conflict classification and reassignment, validation, payload remap, and final
planes use stable disjoint domain ranges; dependent horizon expansion remains
serial. Expected time is O(n log n), with Quickhull's O(n^2) worst case, and
auxiliary storage is O(n + f) including retired work faces. Cancellation is
polled in validation, classification, expansion, and materialization.

Extract Centroid consumes the same packed positions and exact Convex Hull
owner rather than maintaining a second hull implementation. Detail and
per-primitive modes build direct point ranges. Point-owned integer/text pieces
use stable first-occurrence IDs; primitive-owned pieces stable-radix-sort
encoded `(point,piece)` incidences and materialize a unique-point CSR, so
shared corners do not bias the result. Equal-point-mass reduction is
scale-normalized, bounding-box centers use half sums that remain finite across
opposite extreme coordinates, and hull centers reduce endpoint length, planar
triangle area, or translated signed tetrahedral volume as appropriate.

The output is exact-cardinality point-only topology with optional source
primitive numbers or retained/renamed piece identities. Detail attributes are
structurally shared; topology-affine point/corner/primitive groups and fields
are deliberately not guessed. Non-hull independent centers fill disjoint
ranges through the reusable domain pool. Classification and fixed-pass radix
CSR are linear in input incidence up to the machine-word constant; hull mode
adds the documented Quickhull cost per piece. Empty inputs/pieces, malformed
identity fields, non-finite or unrepresentable centers, overflow, and
cancellation fail before an output snapshot is published.

Extract Point from Curve consumes selected open or closed polygon curves and a
scalar point-owned float/integer distance field. A cut is either one finite
constant or a scalar primitive-owned float/integer field. Every authored vertex
whose value equals the cut is emitted once per curve; a strict sign crossing
adds one scale-safe linearly interpolated point. Consequently, plateaus retain
their authored vertices and a closed seam never duplicates its first vertex.
Output order is source primitive then increasing uniform edge parameter.

The exact output cardinality is classified before allocating positions and
provenance planes. Numeric point payload interpolates; integer, text, and ragged
payload uses a deterministic nearest-side rule. Compiled primitive patterns can
be copied to point ownership, detail fields remain structurally shared, and
optional point diagnostics contain curve U, total cuts on the source curve, and
the original primitive number. Generated/preserved name conflicts, malformed
groups and patterns, polygon faces, non-scalar or non-finite fields,
unrepresentable output positions, overflow, and cancellation fail atomically.
Ordinary and topology-affine groups are intentionally absent from the
disconnected point result.

Classification and materialization are O(curve vertices + output payload),
with O(primitives + output) auxiliary storage. Ordinary curve sets use stable
primitive ranges. When the average selected curve exceeds `grain`, stable
primitive-major edge blocks expose even one long curve to the reusable domain
pool; block prefix sums preserve byte-identical order. The measured hot loops
perform no per-edge or per-cut temporary allocation: retained allocation is the
exact output/provenance/payload planes plus O(primitives + blocks) metadata.

Point compaction, optional compacting
primitive deletion, bounding-box construction, and translate/stretch/
contain/cover Match Size also live in this eager packed layer.
Match Axis robustly aligns finite non-zero vectors, including deterministic
parallel and antiparallel cases, and delegates packed position/normal work to
the measured transform kernel.
`Pdk.Analysis` provides bounds; primitive and total polygon area, curve/polygon
perimeter, oriented signed volume; and stable point/primitive connectivity.
Connectivity can restrict the primitive or point topology with packed groups,
cut primitive components at topology-affine native edge seams or exact
float2/float3 vertex-UV discontinuities, and write compact integer IDs or
shared prefixed text labels. Excluded elements receive `-1` or the empty
string rather than being silently assigned to an island.
Measure accepts packed primitive groups, preserves an existing float payload
outside a restricted selection, supports per-element or throughout
accumulation, and can publish the selected total as a detail float. Concave
simple polygons use the shared deterministic ear clipper; triangle-dense
inputs take a direct allocation-free inner path. Primitive ranges write
disjoint slots in parallel and totals reduce in primitive order. Attribute,
ordinary-group, and native-edge-group
buffers remain preserved or explicitly remapped by topology-changing
operators; operations which make
normals invalid remove them rather than retaining stale values.

Group from Attribute Boundary compiles owner-qualified point, vertex, and
primitive attribute patterns once and classifies discontinuities into one
topology-affine native-edge bitset. Canonical `P` participates as a point
float3 plane. Scalar and tuple floating values use component-wise absolute
tolerance after a parallel finite-value validation; integers and text compare
exactly. Point values compare edge endpoints, primitive values compare every
incident face, and vertex values compare corresponding endpoint corners across
every incident side, including non-manifold edges. Optional unshared topology
includes polygon and closed-curve boundaries, with explicit first/last-only or
all-edge policy for open curves. The packed edge result converts directly to
incident points or primitives; primitive output can additionally include every
face sharing a boundary endpoint. Classification is O(attribute payload +
attributes * sum(edge incidence)) time with O(edges / 8) operation-owned
storage beyond the shared topology index. Validation, edge classification,
and owner conversion fill deterministic disjoint ranges in parallel.

Groups from Name reads an explicitly selected point- or primitive-owned text
attribute and emits one ordinary group for each distinct non-empty value.
Names are prefixed and validated after empty values are discarded. Strict mode
ignores invalid ASCII group names; force-valid mode replaces unsupported bytes,
protects a leading digit, and unions normalization collisions. Output groups
follow stable first-value occurrence. Replace and union conflict modes both
publish unordered bitsets, including when the incoming group carried an
explicit traversal order.

The operation first classifies every owner element into one integer plane,
then computes `groups * ceil(elements / 8)` and rejects the cook before dense
membership allocation if either the group-count or packed-payload limit is
exceeded. Existing union membership fills independent group planes in
parallel; generated membership owns disjoint byte ranges. All groups are
installed in one metadata commit. Expected time is O(elements + retained
group bytes), temporary memory is O(elements + retained group bytes), and
retained memory is exactly the packed group payload plus metadata. Reversible
SideFX `encodeattrib` naming is not approximated; it remains an explicit API
gap until its byte-level compatibility contract is implemented.

Name from Groups provides the bounded inverse representation change. It
compiles one include/exclude group-name pattern, resolves matching same-owner
point, vertex, or primitive groups in stable geometry order, and writes their
names to a text attribute. Existing text values or an explicit default cover
unselected elements. Overlaps use deterministic first-group, last-group, or
atomic-error policy; SideFX documents the corresponding case as undefined.
Optional source deletion removes all matched groups in one metadata commit.
The assignment pass reads borrowed immutable packed group bytes through a
fixed byte-to-set-bit table, avoiding an O(groups * elements) membership-call
loop. Time is O(selected packed bytes + selected cardinality + elements),
temporary memory is one integer plane plus the required text output, and text
materialization fills disjoint element ranges in parallel.

Group Random covers Group Create's random-chance plane for point, vertex,
primitive, and native-edge owners. It accepts a finite probability in [0,1],
an optional exact-name base restriction, and the complete packed group merge
algebra. Sampling is stateless through immutable `Rand.t`: points and
primitives use their own number or owner-matched integer seed attribute;
vertices use their referenced point number/value; native edges symmetrically
combine their two endpoint point numbers/values. Exact zero and one avoid the
sampler. Classification is O(owner elements), retains one ceil(n/8) bitset,
and writes disjoint bytes through the shared pool, so fixed inputs retain exact
membership and ordering across domain counts.

Group Bounds covers Group Create's finite bounding-box and bounding-sphere
plane for every topology owner. Point and vertex membership uses the canonical
point position. Full primitive membership requires all referenced points and
partial membership requires any referenced point. Full native edges require
both endpoints; partial native edges use actual segment/box or segment/sphere
intersection, including crossings whose endpoints are both outside. Segment
math is normalized before midpoint, projection, and separating-axis products,
so opposite finite `max_float` coordinates do not overflow. Inclusive boundary
contacts, randomized slab/closest-point reference comparisons, base-group
restriction, full merge algebra, and atomic cancellation are tested. The cook
is O(owner incidence), retains exactly ceil(owner count/8) bytes, and writes
disjoint output bytes in parallel.

Group Normal covers Group Create's direction/spread plane for points,
primitives, and native edges; vertex groups are rejected as SideFX documents.
Primitive normals are implicit polygon winding normals. Point normals are
stable corner-angle-weighted incident-face averages. Native-edge direction is
the normalized mean of its endpoint point normals. Point and edge owners reuse
an existing point float3 `N` by default and otherwise compute geometry normals;
callers can force geometry or name an explicit owner-matched float3 plane.
Primitive owners remain winding-derived unless explicitly overridden. This
also provides the low-latency path when an upstream normal plane is reused.
Direction and normal arithmetic normalize
finite values before products, zero/degenerate directions do not match, spread
angles are inclusive radians in [0, pi], and the optional opposite cap is a
true union. Exact-name bases, the full merge algebra, cancellation, open-curve
exclusion, extreme-coordinate regressions, and one/four-domain equality are
covered. Primitive classification is O(vertices) with only its packed result;
point/edge geometric classification additionally retains temporary SoA face
and, for edges, point direction planes.

Group Non-Planar covers the additive polygon test as a separate typed
primitive operation. For every polygon it chooses the farthest point from an
anchor and then the maximum-area third point, avoiding a fragile first-three
vertices plane; it selects when any vertex's absolute world-space plane
distance is greater than the finite non-negative tolerance. Collinear polygons
and curve primitives remain unselected. Coordinate normalization keeps the
O(vertices), O(1)-scratch-per-primitive test finite near `max_float`. Packed
primitive bytes are filled in disjoint parallel ranges with exact domain-count
parity; union merge reproduces Group Create's documented additive behavior.

Group Backface classifies winding-derived polygon normals relative to a finite
world-space viewpoint. Edge-on, degenerate, and curve primitives remain
unselected. Geometry scale is normalized separately from viewpoint scale, so
finite coordinates near `max_float` retain a stable sign test. Classification
is O(vertices), uses O(1) scratch per primitive, and writes only the exact
packed primitive result in disjoint parallel ranges. Replace merge creates the
backface group; subtract merge removes backfaces from a same-name selection,
matching Group Create's documented backface-removal composition.

Group Edge Depth grows an exact-name point group to every point whose shortest
topology-edge distance from any seed is at most a non-negative depth. Depth
zero retains the seeds, disconnected components remain excluded, and a depth
larger than a seeded component terminates when its frontier is exhausted. The
same bounded multi-source BFS now powers positive point Group Expand and its
step-distance attribute. It visits each reached point and incident edge once,
retains one packed point bitset, and uses a geometric-growth integer queue for
bounded depth; full flood mode allocates its known maximum queue once.

Group Unshared classifies every unique topology edge with exactly one incident
primitive and publishes the result as native edges, incident points, or
incident primitives. Polygon boundary edges and every segment of an isolated
polygon curve therefore follow the same incidence rule. Edge output is the
classification bitset itself; point and primitive conversion traverse cached
compact topology adjacency. All three owners support the complete merge
algebra and exact one/four-domain results.

Group Boundary Components restricts that same one-sided classification to
polygon surfaces, joins boundary endpoints with a stable union-find, and emits
one point group per connected boundary loop or chain. Polygon curves and
non-manifold edges are excluded. Names use the stable
`<prefix>__<component>` policy, with components ordered by their smallest point
number. Group count and packed payload are preflight-bounded before group
allocation; replace and union name-conflict policies are explicit. The pass is
O(edges + points + output payload) time and uses O(points + boundary bits +
output payload) auxiliary memory.

Random, Bounds, Normal, Non-Planar, Backface, Edge Depth, and Unshared share one
initial-merge publisher:
an absent destination is the empty set, so replace/union/xor publish the
generated selection while intersection/subtraction publish empty. Focused
regressions protect these identities for both older and new criteria.

Group Transfer maps destination points, primitives, and native edges to the
closest same-owner source element. Points use `Spatial_index`. Polygon/curve
primitives and unique edges share the private packed `Proximity_index`, whose
features are deterministic ear-clipped triangles or curve/edge segments.
Exact segment/triangle distance handles edge crossings, face containment, and
mixed polygon/curve queries; a median-split feature AABB hierarchy rejects
distant candidates. Source ties resolve by element then feature number.
Feature construction, hierarchy subtrees, target queries, and packed group
fills parallelize over disjoint ranges while immutable public geometry remains
unchanged. When an ordinary source group is ordered, its destination group is
ordered first by source sequence, then exact proximity, then destination index;
unordered groups do not allocate or sort an order plane. Native edge groups
remain topology-affine membership bitsets.

Group Find Path consumes an explicitly ordered point or primitive group and
emits an ordered group with the same owner. Point paths use the cached
topology-edge graph. Primitive paths use the manifold shared-edge dual graph;
non-manifold inputs fail atomically because a unique dual relation is not
defined. Through-each mode joins contiguous base elements and pair mode solves
stable start/end pairs. The path objective is lexicographic: minimum topology
relations, then minimum finite point-edge length or primitive-centroid
distance, then the lower predecessor element. Close mode blocks the primary
route's interior elements and relations before finding a secondary route.
Optional same-owner collision membership is either excluded or used as a
containment region. Shared-element avoidance serializes dependent routes in
base order; independent routes use the reusable domain pool and publish in
pair order. Vertex and ordered-native-edge paths are not exposed.

Finite point weights are built in O(points + edges); primitive weights use
robust scaled centroids and take O(points + vertices + primitives + edges).
Both preparations fill disjoint packed ranges. A point route is O(points +
edges) worst-case; a primitive route is O(primitives + incident vertices).
Scratch is O(owner elements). A synchronized scratch pool bounds live route
workspace to O(workers * owner elements) instead of O(route_count * owner
elements); the ordered result and retained route arrays are O(owner elements)
because group membership cannot repeat an element.

### Rest and motion snapshots

`Pdk.Motion.rest_position` implements Store, Extract, and Swap over canonical
point `P`. Missing rest data turns Extract or Swap into Store, matching the
artist-facing Rest Position contract. An optional equal-cardinality reference
snapshot supplies rest positions; immutable float3 planes are structurally
shared between snapshots and attributes. Optional point-normal storage uses
the same typed validation and sharing boundary. PDK has no transforming
primitive family or float32 attribute representation, so primitive rest
matrices and precision switching are deliberately not synthesized.

`Pdk.Motion.point_velocity` keeps temporal ownership outside the kernel. It
accepts explicit previous/current/next snapshots, positive sample time, and
backward, forward, or central differences. Central differences can emit
acceleration. Incoming, constant, and scaled float3-attribute initialization,
final additive velocity, point-group restriction, and configurable output
names use one atomic metadata commit. Identity Keep and unscaled whole-field
copies structurally share their existing planes. Point-number correspondence requires
equal cardinality; an integer or text point key permits changing cardinality,
rejects ambiguous duplicate reference keys, and applies an explicit error or
zero policy to unmatched current points. Output ranges are stable and disjoint
across domains. Ordinary deformation costs O(current points); keyed matching
costs O(current + sample points) expected time and linear packed lookup/output
storage.

## Performance contract

- Packed dense operations are O(n) time and O(n) output storage unless a
  documented topology algorithm states otherwise.
- Stable sequential and multidomain runs must produce byte-identical topology,
  attributes, group membership, and ordering.
- Kernel grain is explicit and small workloads retain a sequential path.
- No per-element name lookup, boxed vector, list rebuilding, `List.nth`, `@`,
  or repeated array append is allowed in measured hot loops.
- Benchmarks report release profile, input/output cardinality, domains, grain,
  wall time, promoted/major allocation, and peak RSS when practical.
- Scale regressions cover exact cardinality and retained-byte estimates in
  addition to broad diagnostic timing thresholds.

The Scatter rows use `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=scatter` and
`PRISMEL_PDK_SCATTER_COUNT=1000000`. After its output contract and indexed
random stream were fixed, the one-domain uniform baseline took 641.5 ms and
allocated 264.2 MB. Replacing returned float tuples/boxed hot-loop values with
range-local unboxed scratch reduced that to 472.2 ms and 104.0 MB, which is the
exact six float output planes, integer `id`, and three triangle alias arrays
plus bounded range metadata. The density/provenance baseline took 1508.3 ms
and 256.0 MB. Avoiding Attribute Interpolate's 6,000,000-entry
vertex-to-primitive reverse map when no primitive field/group is requested
reduced it to 1155.1 ms and 208.0 MB. Final one/four-domain hashes are exact;
promoted allocation is zero in all four final runs.

The Smooth row uses `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=smooth`. Its input contains 160,801
points and 320,000 triangles, a sparse locked-point group, a patterned
primitive restriction, and group-boundary constraints. The four-domain result
is 2.34x faster with the same exact geometry hash; promoted allocation is zero.
The 21.9 MB allocation is bounded topology-selection metadata plus the two
packed `P`/`Cd` plane sets reused across all eight iterations, rather than
iteration-proportional retained storage.

The Ray rows use `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=ray` and three release-profile
medians. Each cold cook builds the collision BVH, projects 200,901 source
points against 400,000 triangles, and then materializes requested output. Four
domains are 2.52x faster for one ray, 3.11x faster for eight-ray average, and
3.10x faster when the average path repeats chosen hits to produce exact
provenance and `Cd` import. Geometry hashes are byte-exact across domain
counts. Replacing one recursive traversal closure per ray with fixed worker
stacks reduced final one/four-domain single-ray allocation to 141.879/102.575
MB from 207.768/116.170 MB with the established hash unchanged. Eight-ray
average and its provenance/import path allocate 381.365/169.824 MB and
725.351/327.431 MB; the larger numbers include repeated traversal boxing and
the latter's required 48-slot-per-point average CSR payload rather than a
retained temporary hit matrix. One-repeat processes peak at 147,116/153,796
KiB RSS for position/normal output and 225,660/232,948 KiB with provenance,
including fixture construction, Dune, hashing, and the OCaml heap.

The Grid Snap/Fuse rows use `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=snap_to_grid` and
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=fuse`, with three release-profile medians. Snap-only
position ranges scale 2.12x on the million-point all-selection fixture and
1.51x on its alternating-group fixture. Replacing an eight-byte-per-point
boolean change plane plus a second membership scan with a byte-owned packed
bitset improved the all-selection cook from 33.22/18.51 ms to 28.42/13.40 ms
at one/four domains and removed about 8 MB from its one-domain allocation and
major-live measurements. Exact hashes did not change. Fuse cluster discovery
retains stable earliest-source semantics and is deliberately sequential; its
payload/topology remaps parallelize, so the duplicate fixture gains only
1.13x-1.18x without exposing schedule-dependent cluster IDs. Extracting cluster
discovery into one reusable PDK core also lets its cell, representative, size,
and cursor planes share storage across phases. Exact Fuse fell from the prior
71.60/64.97 ms and 104.2 MB to 45.79/40.58 ms and at most 65.61 MB without
changing its hash.

The Modify Target row uses disjoint halves of two offset 500x400 grids,
closest-target links, pairwise weighted-average reduction, exact post-link
fusion, and full topology/payload hashing. It scales 2.01x with identical
one/four-domain cardinality and hash; one/four-domain allocations are
144.79/123.07 MB. The cleanup row fuses horizontal grid neighbors, removes
sequential duplicate corners and sub-cardinality faces, compacts all unused
points, and retains exact ancestry; it scales 1.12x because stable spatial
cluster discovery and prefix planning remain sequential. Its allocations are
110.76/110.82 MB. Three-repeat process peak RSS was 278,144/203,520 KiB for
Modify Target and 195,328/200,320 KiB for cleanup, including fixture setup,
Dune, hashing, and the OCaml heap. These two new rows use Dune's dev profile on
OCaml 5.3.0, Dune 3.24.0, Linux 6.8 aarch64, and four physical cores. Reproduce with
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=fuse_modify_target_weighted_pair` or
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=fuse_cleanup_grid_pairs`, plus
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=3 PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec
tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe`, then repeat with four domains.

The fixed-target rule row copies one float field, converts one integer scalar
to a one-element CSR row, and propagates a target-only point group through the
already selected closest-target map. It takes 131.672/56.996 ms (2.31x),
allocates 81.407/58.096 MB, promotes at most 8,776 bytes, and has exact
one/four-domain hash `4523923909597708345`. The Modify Target rule row reduces
weighted float, integer mode, weight-ordered text concatenation, and strict
majority group membership across pair components. It takes 207.744/104.389 ms
(1.99x), allocates 212.329/164.361 MB, and has exact hash
`2011718227915068739`; 2.70/1.82 MB promotion is retained two-character string
output rather than per-candidate garbage. Process peak RSS was
195,712/203,648 KiB and 203,648/200,576 KiB respectively. Reproduce with
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=fuse_target_attribute_rules` or
`PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=fuse_modify_target_attribute_rules` and the same
three-repeat one/four-domain command above.

The Bound rows use `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=bound` and three release-profile
medians over 1,002,001 source points. Dense divided-box output scales 1.29x and
the 512×256 sphere scales 1.27x with byte-exact geometry hashes; the cheap
alternating-group fixture intentionally stays sequential and equal-speed after
measurement showed domain scheduling cost more than its 12 ms work. Replacing
UV Sphere's builder plus boxed point retrieval in every triangle with exact SoA
planes reduced sphere allocation from 90.13 MB to 21.19 MB and median time from
32.14 ms to 21.83 ms on one domain, with zero promoted bytes and the same hash.

The Match Size rows use `PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=match_size` and five
release-profile medians. Their fixture has 1,002,001 points, 6,000,000 corners,
2,000,000 triangles, and a point-normal plane. The 48.13 MB allocation is the
required immutable position and normal output plus range metadata; it does not
grow with fit mode or iteration. Contain scales 1.28x, selected stretch 1.23x,
and area fit 1.52x at four domains. Area adds deterministic primitive-measure
planes/scratch and reports 73.60 MB at four domains. All three hashes are exact
across domain counts, and a one-repeat four-domain process containing source,
all three cooks, and the benchmark harness peaked at 222,592 KiB RSS.

The 2026-08-02 packed-array Attribute Promote tranche used three process
medians on a 160,801-point/320,000-triangle grid. Four scalar float fields were
promoted together from points to primitive CSR rows; the result contains
960,000 values per field. Allocated bytes include every required output row,
and Unique Values additionally owns one incidence scratch plane per field.

| Four-field array promotion | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Array of All | 30.844 ms | 23.281 ms | 102.415 MB | 3195221879676730096 |
| sorted Unique Values | 74.793 ms | 57.144 ms | 266.255 MB | 1267023885901908324 |

Both hashes are identical across domain counts. Array of All is O(incidences)
time and exact output storage. Unique Values is O(incidences × log(max row))
time with O(incidences + destinations) scratch/output offsets; independent
rows sort and fill in disjoint domain ranges. A separate 40,000-element
same-owner piece regression materializes 1.6 million integer values and
compares every CSR offset/value exactly between one and four domains.
Using typed zero-initialized incidence planes instead of a polymorphic
per-slot initializer reduced Array of All allocation by 37.5% and its
one-domain median by 24.2%; Unique Values allocation fell by 18.7%, with the
same hashes.

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_promote_pattern4_array_all \
  PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=3 PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 \
  dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with domains=4 and filter attribute_promote_pattern4_unique_values.
```

The 2026-08-03 Attribute Promote compatibility tranche retained the same grid
and grain 2,048. Aligned multi-term rename rules are preflighted once; float
tuple extrema preserve one contributing source index per component in a
fixed-width integer CSR row; text/index Average is upper median, Sum is stable
incidence-order concatenation, and other numeric modes fall back to First.

| Promotion path | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocation (1d / 4d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| four scalar values + indices | 57.254 ms | 48.055 ms | 62.474 / 49.269 MB | 1588512353231422235 |
| float4 + component indices | 63.397 ms | 53.747 ms | 75.251 / 62.118 MB | 1105309542113901142 |
| text Sum | 18.448 ms | 7.823 ms | 7.682 / 4.196 MB | 150614732931925070 |

All are five-run release medians and hashes agree exactly across domain
counts. Tuple component indexing is O(incidences × width) time and exact
O(destinations × width) required output at width at most four. Text Sum uses a
checked byte-count pass and one exact output string per destination, for
O(total contributing bytes + incidences) time and O(destinations) scratch.
Single-repeat process peaks were 101,376/107,008 KiB RSS for tuple indexing and
55,168/57,728 KiB for text Sum on one/four domains, including fixtures and the
benchmark harness.

```sh

The 2026-08-02 Unpack tranche was measured separately in the release profile
on the same Linux 6.8 aarch64 four-core environment, OCaml 5.3.0 and Dune
3.24.0, with twenty-one medians. The fixture materializes 4,096 arbitrarily
translated, rotated, and non-uniformly scaled hard-normal boxes carrying a
native edge group: 24 source points and 294,912 output point/vertex/primitive
elements. The legacy baseline transforms every copy and then performs a
general Merge; both transformed paths have the exact hash
`1215420005789118105`.

| Unpack path | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (4d) | Promoted (4d) | Major (4d) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| transform-each + Merge baseline | 29.485 ms | 30.513 ms | 68.00 MB | 6.12 MB | 37.68 MB |
| cardinality-first packed Unpack | 6.203 ms | 5.607 ms | 16.90 MB | 2.40 MB | 8.71 MB |
| packed Unpack, transforms disabled | 1.750 ms | 1.301 ms | 6.41 MB | 0 B | 6.37 MB |

The applied-transform kernel is 5.44x faster than the four-domain composition
and reduces allocated bytes by 75.1% without changing output. A three-repeat
four-domain process containing these rows and the dense single-instance rows
peaked at 61,336 KiB RSS.
The single-instance fast path structurally shares topology, groups, native edge
groups, and unchanged attributes. On a 251,001-point/500,000-triangle grid it
produced the same `1082183089858954941` hash as the ordinary transform while
taking 5.307/1.790 ms on one/four domains versus 5.722/2.071 ms, with 12.06 MB
allocated in both paths.
Reproduce it with:

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=unpack PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=21 \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4.
```

Additional release-profile baseline. Most rows use a
40,401-point/80,000-triangle grid and five medians; the refreshed 2026-08-03
Clip rows use a genuine 1,002,001-point/two-million-triangle grid and three
medians, while the filled sphere row uses its listed 6,050 points:

The 2026-08-02 Attribute Transfer rework was measured again with the same
release profile, machine, five medians, 40,401-point/80,000-triangle source,
and stable exact hashes. Vertex destinations contain 240,000 corners. The quad
index fixture contains 240,000 quads and emits 480,000 internal triangles.

| Transfer/index operation | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

The partial source-vertex follow-up used three process medians on the same
40,401-point/80,000-triangle release fixture. Selecting the first half of its
packed corners with the default all-corners rule retained 40,000 triangles.

| Vertex-restricted operation | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| surface index construction | 20.070 ms | 13.823 ms | 12.633 MB | 3187255119519784648 |
| mixed surface transfer → points | 39.459 ms | 29.834 ms | 22.660 MB | 4528112470654217908 |

Both hashes are identical across domain counts. The selection pass reads the
packed vertex bitset directly, writes one byte per candidate triangle plus one
count per stable range, prefix-sums ranges sequentially, and fills exact-size
triangle planes into disjoint slices. Its auxiliary storage is O(candidate
triangles + ranges), construction retains the existing O(t log t) BVH bound,
and transfer queries retain expected O(q log t) time with O(q) output storage.

Reproduce the isolated transfer rows without constructing unrelated fixtures:

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_transfer_inverse4 \
  PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=5 PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 \
  dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with domains=4 and with filters attribute_transfer_kernel4_hart,
# attribute_transfer_primitives,
# attribute_transfer_vertices, attribute_transfer_surface,
# attribute_transfer_surface_vertex_restricted, surface_index, or
# surface_index_vertex_restricted.
```

The filtered harness reports the actual 40,401-point input in its CSV. A
one-repeat Hart-kernel process peaked at 74,840/56,748 KiB RSS on one/four
domains; the one-domain invocation also rebuilt the release executable, while
the four-domain invocation reused it. A
three-repeat four-domain vertex-transfer run under `/usr/bin/time -v` peaked at
57,656 KiB RSS; the isolated process retained no unrelated million-point
benchmark fixtures.

Spatial-index and surface-index construction now split deterministic disjoint
subtrees above the configured grain. Attribute-transfer queries and payload
interpolation, mirror fills, fuse reductions/remaps, point compaction, and
Match Size also write disjoint output ranges in parallel.
The hashes verify exact ordering and payload equality across domain counts.

The 2026-08-02 blend/multi-owner follow-up used the same release-profile
40,401-point fixture and seven process medians:

| Transfer operation | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| inverse-distance k=4, zero blend | 40.883 ms | 18.553 ms | 4.208 MB | 2242929486872171700 |
| inverse-distance k=4, smooth blend | 65.578 ms | 29.885 ms | 5.826 MB | 3699952128852573101 |
| four owner-specific calls | 350.280 ms | 138.934 ms | 79.806 MB | 3363025554004648849 |
| one `transfer_all` call | 350.430 ms | 140.190 ms | 79.806 MB | 3363025554004648849 |

The pre-change zero-blend medians were 40.556 ms/19.067 ms and 4.206 MB,
so the shared distance-window and batch-commit path changed one-domain time by
+0.8%, four-domain time by -2.7%, and added only 1,912 fixed bytes while
preserving the exact hash. Blended transfer scales 2.19x from one to four
domains. The multi-owner wrapper is within 1% of the identical explicit
sequence and adds only 480 bytes while replacing four graph-level nodes with
one. A separate
4,096-detail-attribute fixture compares the former repeated immutable install
with the batch commit: 61.910 ms/67.879 MB versus 0.566 ms/1.476 MB, a 109x
wall-time improvement and 97.8% allocation reduction with hash
2630023133807264573. The four-domain multi-owner process peaked at 69,504 KiB
RSS under `/usr/bin/time -v`.

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_transfer_inverse4_blend \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_transfer_all \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_transfer_detail \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
```

The same date's million-point Attribute Copy fixture copied four point fields
(float, int, float2, and float3) with exact hashes. Materializing those planes
took 12.302 ms and allocated 56.003 MB. The identity planner instead shared
their immutable storage in 0.017 ms with 7.0 KB allocated. A genuine
quarter-source cyclic copy took 18.626 ms on one domain and 11.427 ms on four
domains, with exact output hashes. The one-domain filtered process peaked at
166,320 KiB RSS including both million-point fixtures and all source payloads.

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_copy PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=3 \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4.
```

The million-point Attribute Combine fixture layers four float4 fields and masks
with the same exact output hash for fused/sequential and one/four-domain runs.

| Combine operation | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| four sequential one-layer commits | 235.223 ms | 111.971 ms | 128.022 MB | 1955258015676273827 |
| one fused four-layer traversal | 171.595 ms | 62.474 ms | 32.008 MB | 1955258015676273827 |
| integer-key matched second input | 59.079 ms | 36.377 ms | 32.784 MB | 3241778002848886381 |

Fusion removes three destination materializations, cuts allocation by 75%, and
scales 2.75x from one to four domains. The matched case includes one exact-size
output, destination map, and bounded-load packed open-address table; replacing
the first boxed hash table reduced measured allocation from 72.395 MB to
32.784 MB. The full filtered one-domain process, including all million-point
source fixtures, peaked at 291,460 KiB RSS.

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_combine PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=5 \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4.
```

The million-destination Attribute Interpolate fixture samples canonical `P`
plus float, int, text, float2, float3, and float4 point fields from one quad.
Seven independent cooks and the fused primitive cook produce exact hash
4556032010648822215 on one and four domains. A second exact hash,
1746913426898666179, covers computed point-number/weight CSR rows and a second
cook driven exclusively by those rows.

| Interpolate operation | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| seven sequential field cooks | 321.172 ms | 126.213 ms | 120.039 MB |
| one fused primitive traversal | 192.449 ms | 75.214 ms | 120.013 MB |
| fused primitive plus computed CSR rows | 241.901 ms | 111.053 ms | 208.015 MB |
| explicit point-number/weight traversal | 255.502 ms | 105.453 ms | 120.014 MB |
| weighted traversal plus one matched point group | 279.323 ms | 110.786 ms | 120.142 MB |

Fusion avoids six repeated driver/topology/weight traversals and metadata
commits while retaining only the exact final payload storage. The computed
case necessarily allocates two CSR offsets planes and four-number/four-weight
rows in addition to field output. The weighted field cook itself allocates only
the exact 120 MB field payload. Removing destination-local iterator closures
reduced its measured allocation from 560.014 MB to 120.014 MB and wall time
from 326.904 ms to 255.502 ms on one domain. The weighted path scales 2.42x at
four domains and preserves the exact computed-mode hash.
One matched group adds only its exact 125,000-byte membership bitset plus
metadata. The group-inclusive hash is 3149981480280984341 on both domain
counts; byte-owned parallel output reduces its incremental one-domain cost of
24.508 ms to 3.067 ms at four domains.

```sh
PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_FILTER=attribute_interpolate PRISMEL_PDK_OPS_REPEATS=3 \
  PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=1 dune exec --profile release tools/bench_pdk_ops.exe
# Repeat with PRISMEL_BENCH_DOMAINS=4.
```

The closest-surface baseline uses the same 80,000-triangle grid, transfers
point `Cd`, vertex `uv`, primitive `density`, and a distance plane to 40,401
offset target points through all-element source/target groups and a smoothstep
blend band. Relative to the first correct tuple-heavy implementation,
packed bounds, exact balanced-node allocation, reusable polygon-triangulation
scratch, range-local query scratch, and non-escaping sequential recursion
reduced surface-index construction from 295.7 ms/620.4 MB to 39.081 ms/21.184
MB and complete point transfer from 348.1 ms/733.3 MB to 74.416 ms/31.209 MB
on one domain. Four domains retain the exact geometry hashes and reduce those
operations to 18.383 ms and 35.478 ms. Global active-axis selection in the
point index reduced the planar k=4 point-transfer baseline from 98.0/51.1 ms;
the current in-place coefficient path takes 38.721/18.063 ms on one/four
domains, and the Hart kernel takes 37.953/19.466 ms. These are five-median
measurements from the same release build; they establish measured production
baselines, not timing thresholds.

Clip accepts canonical `P` or scalar/int/float2/float3/float4 point coordinates;
only the first three components participate and missing components are zero.
Its finite distance translates the plane along the robustly normalized normal,
and its native clipped-edge output replaces a same-named source edge group.
Polygon-only unfilled cooks count source/side results in parallel, prefix them
in stable order, allocate exact output plans, and fill disjoint topology slots.
This reduced the million-point attributed case from 321.898/285.011 ms to
266.471/196.192 ms on one/four domains and from 859.148/859.384 MB to
632.868/556.435 MB, with unchanged hashes. Curves, filled caps, and degenerate
repeated-corner polygons use the general builder. Cap tracing is sequential;
output and auxiliary storage are linear except for the explicit pairwise
containment check among cap loops.

Subdivision topology indexing, manifold/fan validation, exact stencil-plan
construction, and stable child topology emission are sequential. Position and
each typed numeric payload plane evaluate into disjoint ranges in parallel.
The measured attribute-heavy Catmull-Clark fixture improves 1.32× at four
domains and the dense semi-sharp fixture 1.39×; hashes include topology,
attributes, groups, and ordering and are exact across domain counts. One level
is O(points + edges + vertices + payload) time/storage. Iterated output grows
by the scheme's documented child cardinality and each completed level becomes
unreachable before the next once no caller retains it. Local refinement adds
linear selected/unselected extraction, fan splitting, and stable concatenation.
On the 40,401-point/80,000-triangle fixture, a contiguous half selection is
45.092/42.126 ms and a boundary-heavy alternating selection is 78.368/69.726
ms at one/four domains. Their exact hashes match; stable topology partitioning
and fan planning limit scaling despite parallel payload fills.
On the same contiguous selection, Catmull-Clark Do Not Close is 60.233/37.981
ms, Pull Closed/No Edge Division is 71.236/44.817 ms, and Stitch/No Edge
Division is 79.003/71.801 ms. Exact hashes match across domain counts. Pull
adds 14.690 MB and 11.003 ms to the one-domain median without constructing a
second refined topology index; Stitch adds exact bridge topology and payload
remapping for 32.923 MB and 18.770 ms above Do Not Close. Folding bridge
cardinality and ancestry into the initial combine eliminated a second geometry
materialization, cutting Stitch from 84.637 ms/167.561 MB to
79.003 ms/155.226 MB with the same hash. Pull/Divide Edges measures
95.597/85.064 ms and 187.733 MB at one domain; Stitch/Divide Edges measures
92.528/84.267 ms and 187.743 MB. Both divided paths build the coarse chain
directly from source ancestry and fold explicit point welding into final
packed assembly; their one/four-domain hashes are exact. Pull/Triangulate is
105.583/99.790 ms and Stitch/Triangulate is 110.261/94.770 ms, with
212.563/211.425 MB allocated on one domain and exact hashes
`1771144634972156419`/`3868299086784368101` across domain counts.
Consistent Stitch/Divide is 80.425/76.341 ms with 160.110 MB allocated on one
domain; consistent Stitch/Triangulate is 91.859/84.722 ms with 183.091 MB.
Their exact hashes, `2807886286253650657` and `249501161833618177`, match
across domain counts. Avoiding coincidence maps and geometric ear decisions
makes the stronger stability contract cheaper on this fixture despite
retaining every topology-prescribed bridge face. Consistent Pull/Triangulate
is 107.589/98.021 ms with 211.353 MB allocated on one domain and exact hash
`1351686240886644603`.

Deletion planning is stable and sequential; position/attribute/group payload
copies use disjoint parallel ranges. Attribute-heavy quad healing improves
1.28× at four domains. Removing a per-primitive tuple from the measured
planning loop cut that fixture from 45.0 ms/119.4 MB to 35.7 ms/73.2 MB on one
domain and from 32.8 ms/79.1 MB to 27.8 ms/49.7 MB on four domains. Primitive
deletion without compaction shares unchanged point payloads and allocates only
3.89 MB for the retained topology/owner maps.

The merge topology fill was the measured bottleneck: the same local benchmark
fell from 0.903 s to 0.049 s at four domains after switching only its disjoint
index/offset adjustment to packed parallel ranges. Output hashes remained
identical. A three-repeat first-cook run peaked at 181,892 KiB RSS.
The extrusion fixture initially allocated 88.1 MB and took 19.8 ms at four
domains; direct cardinality-indexed writes and disjoint primitive ranges cut
that to 46.6 MB and 5.7 ms with the same output hash.

Box treats positive axis divisions `(dx, dy, dz)` as one integer lattice and
maps its six outward-wound faces into that lattice in stable right, left, top,
bottom, front, back order. Face-local output has
`2*((dx+1)*(dy+1) + (dy+1)*(dz+1) + (dz+1)*(dx+1))` points. Consolidated
surface output has `(dx+1)*(dy+1)*(dz+1) -
(dx-1)*(dy-1)*(dz-1)` boundary points, while the volume-lattice mode retains
the complete first product. The surface has
`2*(dx*dy + dy*dz + dz*dx)` cells: quads emit one primitive/four corners per
cell and triangles emit two primitives/six corners. Cardinalities are checked
before allocation.

Position, normal, UV, topology, offset, and face-group payloads are exact-sized.
Integer-coordinate helpers compute transforms and attributes inside their
single call sites, avoiding boxed float arguments on non-Flambda OCaml. Stable
point/cell ranges write disjoint slices; only the six face ranges and bounded
error flags are auxiliary. Smooth welded point normals are the normalized sum
of incident orthogonal face normals, so face interiors remain flat, edges
average two faces, and corners average three. Work is O(points + vertices +
primitives), auxiliary storage beyond published output is O(dx + dy + dz +
parallel ranges), and one/four-domain geometry is byte-identical.

The Box-specific benchmark command is:

On OCaml 5.3.0/Dune 3.24.0, Linux 6.8 aarch64, four Apple CPU cores, and grain
16,384, five-run release medians were 28.469/19.493 ms for 523,606 face-local
points and 1,040,000 triangles; 9.142/4.242 ms for 520,002 welded surface
points with smooth point normals; 50.498/32.698 ms for the same welded points
and 520,000 quads with hard vertex normals/UV/groups; and 8.939/3.592 ms for a
1,030,301-point volume lattice. Exact hashes respectively remain
`3248985372702655547`, `1256429452418273907`, `825093362255214193`, and
`960043793403492254` across domain counts. Reported one-domain allocations are
59.484, 24.989, 117.422, and 24.741 MB, within bounded control data of their
required packed output. The first correct generic triangle, quad, and lattice
loops allocated 284.592, 379.480, and 156.123 MB by boxing coordinate tuples
and per-cell closures. The compatible 10,000-box batch retains hash
`2906169571501514570`, improves from 6.660/12.170 ms to 4.770/7.102 ms, and
reduces allocation from 67.840 MB to 34.480 MB; it deliberately remains
sequential because each 24-point box is below parallel dispatch grain. The
isolated final four-domain filtered process peaked at 126,188 KiB RSS,
including all five fixtures, hashing, Dune, and the OCaml heap.

UV Sphere treats `segments = s >= 3` as the longitude count and `rings = r >=
2` as the number of pole-to-pole latitude bands. There are `s*(r-1)` interior
points. Modes containing poles add two shared points or `2*s` unique
per-meridian points; row-only output omits unused poles. Regular and alternating
triangles emit `2*s*(r-1)` primitives and three times as many corners. Quad
output emits `s*r` primitives and `4*s*r` corners with logical quad poles, or
`4*s*(r-2) + 6*s` corners with triangular poles. Rows emit `r-1` open curves
and `s*(r-1)` corners; columns emit `s` open curves and `s*(r+1)` corners; the
combined mode is their exact sum. Every product and offset is checked before
allocation.

Latitude and longitude sine/cosine tables are O(r+s), computed once in stable
parallel ranges, and shared by position and normal generation. The compatible
triangle path retains its historical point/primitive order and exact normal
bits while replacing per-point latitude trigonometry and per-triangle geometric
winding classification with fixed outward index patterns. Ellipsoid normals
use inverse-radius gradient weights scaled by the minimum radius; a logarithmic
fallback covers finite anisotropy whose ratios underflow. Surface UVs are
vertex-owned so the longitude seam never crosses a primitive. Position,
normal, UV, topology, offset, and kind planes are exact-sized and filled in
disjoint stable ranges. Work/output are O(s*r), auxiliary storage beyond
published output is O(s+r+parallel ranges), and one/four-domain output is
byte-identical.

When triangular poles are disabled, each pole band intentionally remains a
four-corner polygon with one coincident adjacent edge. The shared triangulation
boundary recognizes exactly one such collapsed edge, verifies that the three
remaining positions have non-zero scale-normalized area, emits one triangle,
and remaps vertex attributes from the surviving corners. Arbitrary degenerate
or non-simple polygons continue to fail rather than being silently repaired.

The UV Sphere benchmark command is:

On OCaml 5.3.0/Dune 3.24.0, Linux 6.8 aarch64, four Apple CPU cores, and grain
16,384, five-run release medians and one-domain allocations were:

| UV Sphere fixture | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,000,002-point compatible triangles | 66.733 ms | 40.679 ms | 114.044 MB | 1383169697053155230 |

Every allocation is the published packed payload plus bounded tables/range
state. Before the compatible-path rewrite, the first fixture took
87.170/47.487 ms, allocated 114.002 MB, and had the same exact hash. The final
five-fixture four-domain process peaked at 173,640 KiB RSS including Dune,
hashing, and the OCaml heap.

Torus treats `rows = r` as U samples along the major sweep and `columns = c`
as V samples around the cross-section. A wrapped axis has one cell per sample;
an open axis includes both requested angle endpoints and has one fewer cell.
Writing `u = r` or `v = c` at a wrapped topology seam reuses point zero while
retaining vertex UV 1, so no polygon crosses the normalized seam. The point
count is exactly `r*c`. With `ur = r` or `r-1` and `vc = c` or `c-1`, surface
output has `ur*vc` cells: quads emit one primitive/four corners per cell and
triangle modes emit two primitives/six corners. Row output has `c` U curves
and `r*c` corners; column output has `r` V curves and `r*c` corners; combined
output is their sum.

For open U, U caps add two polygon primitives and `2*c` corners. For open V,
the V closure adds `ur` quads or `2*ur` triangles and four or six times `ur`
corners. Cap requests are rejected when their axis wraps, when connectivity is
not polygonal, or when a requested boundary is geometrically degenerate.
Signed U/V ranges are supported in every combination: surface winding is
reversed exactly when one parameter direction descends, and cap order/normals
follow the signed sweep. Smooth point normals retain the toroidal field; vertex
normals make U/V caps hard.

Sine, cosine, and normalized-parameter tables require O(r+c) auxiliary
storage. Position, point-normal, topology, vertex-normal, UV, offset, and kind
planes are exact-sized, and all dense fills use stable disjoint ranges with
cancellation polling. Work/output are O(r*c), auxiliary storage beyond the
published result is O(r+c+parallel ranges), and one/four-domain output is
byte-identical. No per-point/corner float boxes remain in the measured paths.

The output-equivalent sequential reference took 174.728/182.901 ms, allocated
210.002 MB, and retained the compatible hash. The final three-repeat
four-domain process peaked at 173,548 KiB. Prismel's polygon subset was audited
against the current [SideFX Torus SOP](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/torus.html):
native analytic, single Mesh/NURBS/Bezier, spline-order, and rational
perfect/imperfect modes remain explicit omissions rather than placeholders.

Tube treats `rows = r` as axial samples and `columns = c` as radial samples.
Each nonzero-radius row owns `c` points; a zero-radius end owns one shared apex.
When caps do not consolidate corner points, each capped nonzero end adds `c`
private points. For polygon output, let `t` be the number of apex-adjacent
bands (zero or one), `b = r - 1 - t`, and `k` the number of capped nonzero
ends. Quad mode emits `(b+t)*c+k` primitives and
`(4*b+3*t+k)*c` corners. Either triangle mode emits
`(2*b+t)*c+k` primitives and `(6*b+3*t+k)*c` corners. Thus a cone tip is a
ring of real triangles sharing one point, never a ring of coincident points or
degenerate quads. Longitudinal rows use `c` open curves and `r*c` corners;
radial columns use one closed curve and `c` corners for every nonzero row.

Side normals use the analytic frustum gradient and remain smooth across the
radial seam. Vertex normals keep cap corners hard; independent cap points also
give point-normal output a hard rim. Side UVs preserve `u = 1` at the topology
seam without duplicating positions, while cap UVs are planar. Position,
topology, normal, UV, and group planes are exact-sized. Radius/height and
trigonometric tables require O(r+c) auxiliary storage; generation is O(r*c)
time and output, with stable disjoint band fills, cancellation polling, and
byte-identical one/four-domain results.

The prior general Sweep-based million-point cylinder baseline took
65.925/64.522 ms and allocated 201.021 MB. The dedicated source retains the
same output cardinality while cutting allocation 23.9%, matches its sequential
latency, and is 1.48x faster at four domains. The final three-repeat
four-domain process peaked at 173,652 KiB. Prismel's polygon subset was audited
against the current [SideFX Tube SOP](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/tube.html):
native analytic Primitive and single Mesh/NURBS/Bezier families, spline U/V
orders and wrap, and rational perfect/imperfect modes remain explicit

Platonic Solids stores one normalized immutable coordinate/topology/face-normal
table for each regular polyhedron. Tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron,
and dodecahedron retain their natural three-, four-, or five-corner faces. The
soccer ball is the exact edge-third truncation of the icosahedron: its 60
directed-edge points form twelve pentagons followed by twenty hexagons, with 90
two-manifold edges, black/white primitive `Cd`, and optional arity groups.
Every point lies at the requested circumsphere radius. Point normals are radial;
vertex normals are constant per polygon and preserve hard edges through terminal
N-gon triangulation. `Geom.Polyhedra3` calls this kernel and no longer owns a
second vertex/face implementation.

All cardinalities are fixed and bounded by 60 points, 180 corners, and 32
primitives. Cook time, output, and auxiliary memory are therefore O(1).
Parallel dispatch is intentionally skipped because its setup exceeds the whole
solid generation cost; outputs remain byte-identical under one- and four-domain
sketch contexts.

The Platonic benchmark commands are:

```sh

On OCaml 5.3.0/Dune 3.24.0, Linux 6.8 aarch64, four Apple CPU cores, the
100,000-call icosahedron batch (1.2 million generated points) improved from
83.603 ms and 696.800 MB to 23.459 ms and 266.400 MB with exact hash
`108589944924191245`: 3.56x faster and 61.8% less allocation. A 20,000-call
transformed soccer-ball batch with vertex normals, primitive color, and face
groups took 49.815 ms and 292.640 MB with hash `4440798644007023453`. The final
three-repeat process peaked at 54,496 KiB. The public subset was audited against
the current [SideFX Platonic Solids SOP](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/platonic.html):
the mathematical solids and soccer ball are implemented; Houdini's bundled
fixed Utah-teapot test asset is an explicit non-procedural omission.

Revolve consumes selected open or closed polygon curves and assigns one
deterministic output lattice to each profile. A full revolution has `d`
angular samples and wrapped edges; an open arc has `d+1` samples and includes
both requested signed-angle endpoints exactly. Points, angular rows, profile
columns, both curve families, quads, and the regular/reverse/checkerboard
triangle splits share one cardinality plan. Reversing the cross section changes
profile traversal and winding without mutating the source.

Each source corner normally owns one angular ring. A corner exactly on the
rotation axis instead owns one point: adjacent cells become `d` triangles and
an axis-to-axis cell emits nothing. This avoids coincident points and
degenerate pole quads while preserving stable profile order. Full polygon
surfaces may add one N-gon for each non-axis endpoint of an open profile;
axis endpoints are already closed and never receive a degenerate cap.

Source point, vertex, primitive, and detail payload and ordinary groups follow
packed ancestry maps. Point/vertex `N` is invalidated because revolution
changes its frame. Native input edges map to every generated profile edge by
parallel classification of the target unique-edge plane. Normalized profile
arc length is U and angular position is V; polygon surfaces store seam-safe
vertex UVs, while free-point output stores point UVs.

For selected profile corners `v`, emitted surface primitives `f`, and topology
corners `c`, work is O(v*d + f + c) and published storage is O(v*d + f + c).
Auxiliary storage is O(source vertices + output primitives), including ring,
profile-distance, and stable per-edge output-range planes. Surface edges write
disjoint ranges through the reusable domain pool; rule order, primitive order,
and every output hash are independent of domain count. All cardinalities,
finite positions, curve kinds/lengths, axis normalization, UV/group names, and
cancellation are validated before an immutable geometry is published. The
polygon subset is audited against the current
[SideFX Revolve SOP](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/revolve.html).

Spiral emits one open polygon curve per phase copy. With `d` divisions and `s`
spirals, positions, vertices, and every requested point attribute have exactly
`s*(d+1)` entries, primitive offsets have `s+1` entries, and distance resets to
zero at every curve. Per-turn divisions use `ceil(turns*divisions_per_turn)`
segments and still include the exact requested endpoint. Archimedean radius is
linear in turns; logarithmic radius is geometric. Both accept change-per-turn
or exact end-radius controls before a positive global radius scale and a
piecewise-linear radius ramp. Height is `height*t*height_ramp(t)`.

Equal-angle sampling fills the shared per-curve parameter table directly.
Equal-arc sampling integrates the analytic ramped curve speed with fixed
five-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Its ordered integration partition merges
uniform parameter bins with every interior height/radius ramp knot, so a
derivative discontinuity is never integrated as a smooth interval. An ordered
prefix sum followed by binary bin lookup and four bounded Newton corrections
produces deterministic sample parameters. Multiple phase copies reuse the
same radius/height/trigonometric tables.

Requested X/Y/tangent axes form a right-handed orthonormal point frame. The Y
axis is the central axis projected perpendicular to the finite-difference
tangent; a stable radial fallback handles locally axial tangents. `orient`
encodes the same basis as a normalized float4 quaternion. Cumulative polygon
distance uses fixed 4,096-segment blocks: block totals cook independently,
their prefixes are accumulated in curve/block order, and disjoint final fills
retain byte-identical one/four-domain results. Point/frame hot loops allocate
no per-element boxes.

Let `n=d+1`, `s` be spiral count, and `k` be the total number of ramp keys.
Equal-angle work is O(n+s*n), while equal-arc work is
O(k*log k+n+k+n*log(n+k)+s*n); sorting is limited to interior ramp keys.
Published output is O(s*n). Shared profile/integration tables use O(n+k)
auxiliary storage, frame/distance block state is O(s*n/4096), and no output is
generated before cardinality and OCaml array limits are validated.

The Spiral benchmark commands are:

On OCaml 5.3.0/Dune 3.24.0, Linux 6.8 aarch64, four Apple CPU cores, grain
16,384, and five-run release medians:

| Spiral fixture | 1 domain | 4 domains | Allocated (1d) | Exact hash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,000,001-point equal-angle Archimedean curve | 42.837 ms | 30.393 ms | 80.006 MB | 3136671808158376137 |

The output-equivalent boxed tuple plus generic Polyline reference took
107.229 ms and allocated 128.003 MB with the first fixture's exact hash. The
dedicated equal-angle kernel is therefore 2.50x faster and allocates 37.5%
less on one domain. The advanced all-attribute result is 2.54x faster on four
domains than one, and its allocation is its packed output plus bounded shared
integration/profile tables. The three-repeat four-domain equal-arc process
peaked at 178,856 KiB RSS including both fixtures, hashing, Dune, and the OCaml
heap. The polygon subset was audited against the current
[SideFX Spiral SOP](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/spiral.html):
native NURBS/Bezier curves and curve-order controls remain explicit omissions.

Before the Grid rewrite, the compatible million-point triangle source measured
139.22 ms at one domain and 127.86 ms at four domains. The production kernel's
five-run medians are 42.29 ms and 26.87 ms with the identical
`3253461948889680712` geometry hash: 3.29x and 4.76x faster respectively, with
the four-domain result 1.57x faster than one domain. Required output remains
the allocation floor (114.22 MB for triangles); the four-mode run peaked at
138,744 KiB RSS. Row-major point generation removes per-point division, while
surface/curve topology and offsets use exact disjoint output ranges.

The Circle-specific command is:

```sh

```

The former closed-Circle path generated a boxed tuple array, rebuilt it through
a packed builder, and remained serial: 92.75 ms at one domain, 88.49 ms at four,
and 112.23 MB allocated for 1,002,001 points. The new exact-sized source retains
the identical `1595635405635298122` hash and measures 22.94/13.21 ms: 4.04x
faster at one domain, 6.70x faster at four, and 71.4% less allocation. The
four-domain three-mode run peaked at 54,072 KiB RSS. Independent ellipse,
orientation, and sliced-arc math stays in the same point loop instead of
creating transform or topology intermediates.

## Boolean intersection detection

`Pdk.Boolean.run` is the public exact polygon-product boundary over the single
PDK arrangement core. It builds the arrangement once, evaluates union,
intersection, either subtraction direction, or XOR for independently typed
solid/surface operands, transfers the complete supported payload schema through
exact ancestry, verifies rounded output, and optionally splits seam points or
detriangulates safe same-source patches. Point conflicts are explicitly
rejected or promoted to vertex ownership. Cut components with multiple
boundary cycles stay triangulated because the packed polygon representation
does not encode holes. Solid Shatter reuses that arrangement and emits stable
A-only/overlap/B-only boundaries with optional distinct primitive groups. The
function returns structured errors, honors the
shared cancellation token/grain, and produces exact ordered output across
domain counts.

`Pdk.Boolean.seam` exposes the same arrangement's seam products without
reimplementing intersection decisions. Curve output can name left-self,
between-input, and right-self primitive groups independently; coincident output
returns exact coincident triangle patches with an optional named group. Both
forms retain cancellation and exact ordered one-/multi-domain behavior.

`Pdk.Ops.boolean_detect` is the packed diagnostic stage shared by one-input
AxA self detection and two-input AxB detection. It triangulates selected simple
polygons only inside immutable `Surface_index` values, preserving the source
topology and every existing payload plane. A two-pass BVH traversal first
counts and then fills exact-size triangle-pair arrays; no candidate list or
boxed bounds object is allocated in a leaf loop.

AxB retains left-triangle order. AxA retains only increasing internal-triangle
pairs from different source primitives, so reverse duplicates and one polygon's
triangulation diagonals never enter the narrow phase. Range-local float and
integer scratch normalizes each pair around a shared local origin, classifies
crossing/touching and optional coplanar overlap, and distinguishes genuine
self-overlap from contact that exists only through shared point IDs. Each AxA
primitive pair is written in both directions before per-primitive heapsort and
stable deduplication, producing symmetric `Int_array` rows.

Optional outputs are primitive groups, primitive `Int_array` intersecting-ID
rows, and primitive integer row counts. AxA and AxB output names must be
distinct within each metadata namespace. Installation is functional and
atomic: a later validation/cancellation failure cannot expose already
constructed intermediate metadata. Surface indexes, broad/narrow ranges, row
sorts, and group fills use the reusable `Parallel` pool; source topology,
positions, unrelated attributes, and groups remain structurally shared.

Expected time is O((A+B) log B + C + sum k log k) for AxB and
O(A log A + C + sum k log k) for AxA, with O(A+B+C+I) auxiliary storage for
surface indexes, candidates, and retained primitive entries. Exact sparse,
coplanar, and self-crossing baselines are maintained in
`specification/performance.md`. Classification uses an explicit locally scaled
floating tolerance; it is not the adaptive/arbitrary-precision predicate
required to construct topology-changing Boolean seams.

## Intersection point analysis

`Pdk.Ops.intersection_analysis` consumes a packed BVH of triangle and
polygon-curve segment pieces and uses the same `Triangle_intersection` narrow
phase as Boolean Detect for triangle pairs. Its result is point-only geometry.
With one input it visits unordered AxA pairs;
with a collision input it visits ordered AxB pairs. Input geometry is never
passed through. Ordinary self-contact at a shared source vertex or edge is
suppressed, while duplicate faces and coplanar overlap beyond a shared edge
produce events.

The triangle/triangle, segment/segment, and segment/triangle narrow phases
write at most twelve pair-local records into worker-owned fixed scratch. A
count pass preflights exact event cardinality; a second pass fills disjoint
packed position and parameter planes. Stable spatial welding
then merges the same intersection location discovered through several
piece pairs. The weld threshold is the larger of the explicit world-space
tolerance and a bounded extent/ULP numerical floor. The earliest raw event
owns the published position, so work-stealing order cannot change coordinates
or point numbering.

Optional point-owned attributes default to `sourceinput`, `sourceprim`,
`sourceprimuv`, and `sourcepoint`. Their CSR rows are aligned by incident
primitive incidence. Triangle `sourceprimuv` records are barycentric;
polygon-curve records are `(u, 0, 0)`, where `u` spans the complete curve.
Every record has three floats, and `sourcepoint` stores the coincident source
point number or `-1`. Provenance is deduplicated by packed parameter incidence
in stable first-incidence order without a per-output hash table. Adjacent
segments share their internal endpoint incidence, while two distinct
parameters remain visible when one curve primitive crosses itself.

For A and B input linear pieces, C broad-phase candidates, E raw events, and R
retained provenance records, expected time is
O((A+B) log(A+B) + C + E) and auxiliary storage is O(A+B+C+E+R).
Mixed-piece index construction, count/fill narrow phases, and representative
position extraction use disjoint parallel ranges. Stable event welding and
provenance aggregation are currently serial and dominate dense coplanar
workloads. Selected polygons must be triangles; open and closed polygon curves
are processed as stable segments without a second topology representation.
