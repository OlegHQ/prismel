# Procedural SOP graphs

Status: first coherent graph and core-node iteration implemented.

## Product intent

`rays.procedural` combines Processing-style immediacy with a non-destructive
SOP workflow. A new user should be able to construct, animate, inspect, and
render an interesting model without learning packed storage. The same
`Rdk.Geometry.t` remains available to advanced users who descend to native
kernels; there is no separate easy-but-slow geometry model.

The common path is a functional pipeline:

```ocaml
let terrain =
  Sop.grid ~columns:180 ~rows:180 ~size:12. ()
  |> Sop.noise_displace ~amplitude:0.7 ~frequency:0.18 ~seed:42
  |> Sop.color_by_height ~low:Color.indigo ~high:Color.orange
```

One-input modifiers pipe naturally. Multi-input nodes use descriptive labels,
for example `Sop.copy_to_points ~source:tree ~targets:points ()`. Familiar words
are preferred in this layer (`attribute`, `primitive`, `geometry`); abbreviated
HDK vocabulary remains available in the expert RDK namespace.
Use `Sop.delete_attributes ~point_pattern:"tint" input None` to delete one point
attribute, or set patterns for several owners in one node. The editor uses the
same `Delete Attributes` node; the old single-name node is removed.
`Sop.rename_attributes ~rules:[...]` handles exact names and wildcard
captures with owner and conflict rules; an unmatched rule leaves geometry
unchanged. The editor uses `Rename Attributes`.
`Sop.promote_attributes ~pattern:"weight"` handles a single source attribute;
output and index patterns can rename its promoted values and source indices.
The editor uses the same `Promote Attributes` node for one or many attributes.
An unmatched pattern leaves geometry unchanged.
Use `Sop.group_rename ~rules:[...]` for owner-scoped or multiple group renames;
the editor exposes the same rule-based `Group Rename` node.

## Ownership and dependency boundary

Procedural owns immutable graph nodes, operator contracts, parameter/context
dependencies, validation, diagnostics, cooking, inspection, and bounded
session caches. It may use RDK and public Rays value semantics. It
does not import Runtime, SDL3, Metal, or platform policy.

Cooking produces `Payload.Geometry of Rdk.Geometry.t` or `Payload.Image of Image.t`.
The image stores row-major RGBA float samples in [0,1] or owned RGBA8 bytes, four per pixel. Its
constructor copies public input; its public pixel reader returns a copy.
Images and geometry share `Rdk.Data_id.fresh`, so session component accounting
cannot confuse their identities. An image contributes one component of
`width * height * 4 * 8` bytes for float storage, or `width * height * 4`
bytes for RGBA8. An exact float consumer explicitly expands byte storage to
normalized samples; the image retains no additional materialized copy. Cache keys use payload identity; selective
attribute keys, geometry deltas and instance materialization apply to geometry.
`Payload.geometry` and `Payload.image` return `E_PAYLOAD` for the other variant.
Existing SOPs use the geometry adapter and refuse image inputs at that boundary.

`image/noise :width :height :frequency :seed` in an `image` graph cooks seeded
grayscale noise with opaque alpha on the shared worker pool. Width and height
default to 256, frequency to 0.02 and seed to 0. Domain count does not enter its
cache key: one and eight domains produce identical samples.

`image/map (fn [uv] [uv.x uv.y 0.5 1]) :width :height` defaults to 256×256.
The Flow_sop bridge prepares one immutable packed pixel-center UV grid and
compiles the actual function and captures. A session cook executes the packed
map and converts finite Vec4 channels to an owned RGBA8 image with the shared
pool. Conversion clamps to [0,1], scales by 255 and rounds ties to even.
Existing float-backed noise and sampling keep their original precision.
Workspace display may independently execute a qualified pixel function on the
GPU. SOP payload resolution still cooks this CPU node, never a resident GPU
readback, and preserves older immutable payloads across display updates and
resize. No GPU handle enters a procedural payload or session cache.

An explicit bridge converts geometry to `Rays.Mesh.t`, which `Scene3` lowers
through the native OGPU/Metal path.
A cook context may copy scalar facts from `Rays.Frame.t`, but
it must not retain a canvas, renderer, texture, or backend handle.

`Procedural.Instances.t` is a separate packed value: it retains one prototype
node plus a packed array of immutable transforms. It is not itself editable
topology.
`Sketch_support.Bridge.cook_to_scene3` cooks/caches the prototype once and constructs the
instance node. `Sketch_support.Bridge.cook_to_instances` returns
an owned transform copy for callers that need custom scene assembly. Use
materialized `Sop.duplicate` or Copy to Points when downstream SOPs need
per-copy topology.

## Node-owned parameter templates and inspectors

`Procedural.Parameter` separates an operator's immutable parameter template
from its current record value. This follows the same architectural distinction
as Houdini's `ParmTemplate` versus `Parm`: metadata describes type, internal
name, label, folder, default, and UI policy, while the user's immutable record
stores current values. Numeric templates have a soft drag range and optional
hard bounds. Soft bounds never truncate typed, programmatic, initial, or
persisted values; hard bounds normalize every write.

`Node.parameterize` couples one schema, one immutable record, and the pure
rebuild function to the concrete SOP node that owns them. Sessions hash the
schema cook key plus any intrinsic operator identity, such as a snapshot's
data id. Schema text used for inspection is excluded from that intrinsic key;
custom wrappers retain their wrapped operator's identity. `Node.parameter_fields`
is the narrow type-erasure boundary used by inspectors. `Edit_graph.apply_parameters`
edits a selected node in the immutable document; compiling it preserves logical
node IDs and shared DAG identity. A `Cook` field
replaces that node's cook closure and cache-key parameters; `View` and `Export`
fields update metadata without invalidating cooked geometry. `Node.parameterize`
also records `Parameter.cook_key` of the values as `Node.parameter_key`, and the
session cache identity includes it next to the operator's own parameter string,
so every cook-impact schema field changes the key even when an operator's
hand-written key omits it.

`Graph.inspect` is an uncached traversal. Repeated inspection can use the
bounded `Session.inspect` cache, whose lifetime follows the owning session.
The sketch cook scheduler retains one graph's dependency summary in its
immutable schedule state, so an unchanged graph needs no traversal per frame.

A session remains single-caller. Independent input branches and concrete zone
elements may cook on the shared `Parallel` pool, with one coarse branch per
chunk. The automatic gate requires at least two uncached branches and multiple
domains; a branch qualifies when the measured own times of its uncached
subtree sum to at least 2 ms, or, when a timing has expired, a retained output
has at least 10,000 points. Shared or cached ancestors contribute no work.
A new session
without these measurements runs sequentially. Cache hits remain inline.

Shared ancestors are evaluated once on the caller in the original DFS prefix
order. Each worker owns a copy of cache metadata (including CLOCK touch bits),
volatile slots and the cook memo, while immutable payload planes are shared.
The caller validates and applies read/write journals in input order. If an
earlier branch evicted an entry observed by a later worker, that later branch
is reevaluated against the current parent. Parent cache mutation, diagnostics,
retention and counters therefore follow sequential execution. Opaque expansion
stays on the caller until its concrete roots are known. Cancellation discards
uncommitted branch outputs and reports errors in input order.

SOPs and sketches attach schemas to individual nodes. There is no sketch-wide
promoted record that shadows the graph; `Edit_graph` owns document edits.

The runtime API is PPX-independent. Templates may be written directly with
`Parameter.field` and `Parameter.schema`. The optional `rays.ppx` deriver
removes record boilerplate:

```ocaml
type controls = {
  divisions : int
    [@sop.default 16] [@sop.label "Divisions"]
    [@sop.folder "Geometry"] [@sop.min 1] [@sop.max 64]
    [@sop.hard_min 1];
  amplitude : float
    [@sop.default 0.25] [@sop.folder "Noise"]
    [@sop.min 0.] [@sop.max 1.];
  explosion : float
    [@sop.default 0.] [@sop.folder "View"]
    [@sop.min 0.] [@sop.max 2.] [@sop.impact "view"];
}
[@@deriving sop_params]

let grid_node input p =
  Custom.map ~label:"deform" ~operation:"custom-deform"
    ~schema:controls_schema ~values:p input
    (fun ~parameters:_ ~context:_ geometry ->
      (* Call typed RDK operations here. *)
      Ok geometry)
```

The deriver emits `controls_default` and `controls_schema`. Every record field
requires `[@sop.default ...]`. Primitive `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `string`
kinds are inferred; numeric fields require soft `[@sop.min]`/`[@sop.max]`.
`[@sop.hard_min]` and `[@sop.hard_max]` opt into strict normalization.
`[@sop.label]`, `[@sop.name]`, `[@sop.description]`, slash-separated
`[@sop.folder]`, and `[@sop.impact "cook"|"view"|"export"]` provide layout and
behavior. `[@sop.kind expression]` supplies arbitrary typed choices, and
`[@sop.ignore]` retains a record field/default without promoting it.
`[@sop.primary]` marks default card rows; checked `[@sop.vec3 "center"]`
groups three consecutive float components into one vector row and port.

Schemas live in the dependency-free `param` library. `Pxui_shell.Inspector`
converts a node.s folders to nested accordions and kinds to native widgets; the
host applies the returned changes through
`Node.apply_parameters`, synchronizes hard-bound normalization, and returns
accumulated effects. The host applies that edit to `Edit_graph`.
Procedural never imports PXUI, and PXUI never gains SOP knowledge. A schema
builds an O(1) field-name lookup once; ordinary frames with no relevant change
do no parameter synchronization or graph work.
Persisted parameter state belongs to the graph/node layer. The selected-node
inspector is regenerated from concrete node metadata and never imports an
independent canvas-wide shadow record.

A SOP node is one declaration: its `parameters` record. With
`[@@deriving sop_params, sop_node]` it yields the inspector schema, the Lisp
manifest entry, editor factory and typed `Procedural.Sop.<key>` constructor.
The typed arguments follow record order: optional fields, one `Vec3.t` per
`sop.vec3` group, then positional input ports (or `()` for a generator).
There is no separate function name, argument list or typed default override.
Defaults, validation and cache identity therefore
cannot drift between the API and the editor. Such declarations live in
`lib/procedural` (`sop_groups.ml`, `sop_topology.ml`, `sop_attributes.ml`,
`sop_shapes.ml`) next to their cooks; `Procedural.Nodes` exports their
factories and `sop.ml` aliases their typed functions. A typed optional takes
the editor default. Parameter-free nodes declare `type parameters = unit`;
the same derivation supplies an empty schema and the typed input-only
constructor. Null and Compact Points use this path, with no artificial fields.
An input-dependent inspector can supply `parameters_build ~schema`, deriving
presentation from the constructed node while retaining the record's fields and
defaults. The builder evaluates the operator once and refreshes that schema on
edits and rewiring. Labeled index choices retain integer values and port types.
Group Random and Noise Displace expose their existing `context_seed` switch:
both default to explicit seed 0, while `context_seed:true` selects the cook
context independently of whether a seed argument was supplied. Point Jitter's
vector argument is `axis`; Point Velocity uses `set` and `add`; UV Sphere uses
one `radius` vector alongside its three radius-mode choices, matching Lisp.
PolyWire and Sweep Circle share one parameter record and cook, exposed as
`sop/polywire` and `sop/sweep_circle` with distinct runtime identities. Their
U/V range toggles preserve the kernel's meaningful omitted-range path; the
Lisp defaults keep both ranges explicit. The typed APIs flatten endpoint and
UV ranges and use the same defaults and validation as their factories.
The ten recorded default drifts are settled; existing
OCaml callers explicitly pass their former defaults. Box defaults to quads;
Tube defaults to triangles with end caps. Box's normals choice includes Auto
(`~normals:None`), which lets the kernel decide; the default remains Vertex.
Bound exposes separate box/sphere resolution and grouped lower/upper padding;
its numeric and output-name checks run before construction. Match Size exposes
independent move/source/target selection owner and name fields, separate axis
toggles and a positional optional target. Target justification defaults to
Explicit zero; Auto inherits the source justification as the kernel does.
Origin Point Generate exposes its generated group and source metadata names.
Rewire Vertices defaults to deleting the target attribute, as in Lisp, and
exposes selection owner/name fields. Distance Along Geometry and Distance from
Target expose owner/name selections and a radius mode plus fixed radius.
Distance from Geometry uses the same fields for source/reference selections
and takes both nodes positionally.
Revolve derives optional divisions, origin and axis, with blank UV names
disabling output. Its resolution, axis, arc-span and cap-mode constraints
run at construction for both typed and factory paths.
Platonic exposes orientation choice and custom axis separately, defaulting to
Dodecahedron and Vertex normals as in Lisp. Its catalog create entry aliases
the derived typed constructor. Edge Transport takes the First/Last/Group root
choice and defaults to Zero root value; constant integration or edge-length
scaling requires Total mode for network, curve and parent transport alike.
Blank distance output names disable that plane; at least one distance or mask
output must remain. Their numeric, name and mode constraints run at construction.
Material uses optional `material`, `color`, `roughness`, and `emission` fields
with the Lisp defaults and rejects non-finite or out-of-range channels at
construction. `[@sop.nonblank]` / `[@sop.validate]` make the
typed constructor raise where the editor clamps; `[@sop.present]` /
`[@sop.absent]` tie a toggle field to a typed optional's presence. The node's
cache identity is the schema's `Parameter.cook_key`, and `Node.parameters`
reads as `Parameter.cook_text` (`name=value;...`) unless the cook retains
legacy diagnostic text; that text does not replace the schema cache key.
Checks involving several fields or encoded values use
`[@@sop.validate fun parameters -> ...]` on the record. The generated builder
runs that pure check before constructing the operator, for both typed calls
and factory rebuilds. Invalid editor writes return an error and retain the
existing node. Extract Centroid, Ordered Group and Group by Normal use this
for reserved names, negative indices and non-zero directions respectively.
Delete Attributes takes its input and optional reference positionally. Curves
and Parent edge transport default the root value to Zero, as in Lisp; callers
that need the former OCaml default pass `Transport_root_hold` explicitly.
Every node with a Lisp kind is declared this way; only helpers without one
(`snapshot`, `points`, `polyline`, `group`, custom cooks) stay hand-written in
`sop.ml`. A node writes no parameter text of its own: its inspection text and
cache key are derived from the record. Switch keeps its `a` and `b` ports and
takes further branches through the optional repeated `inputs` port.

`rays.sop_catalog` registers every node and declares none. A parameter type
uses `[@@deriving sop_params, sop_node]` together with stable key, runtime
operation identity, label, category-path, and input-arity attributes. The
operation defaults to the key; `sop.node_operation` records deliberate aliases.
`sop_node` also generates `parameters_build`: given an operator
`fun ~label parameters input0 ... -> node` (one `Node.t` per required slot, one
`Node.t option` per optional slot), it returns the recursive, arity-checked
`build ~label ~inputs parameters` that attaches the schema through
`Node.parameterize` and rebuilds itself after edits. The generated
`parameters_factory build`
binds the same defaults and rebuild function used by inspection. A catalog
module is therefore the parameter record, one `parameters_build` operator, and
`let factory = parameters_factory build`; only nodes with external callers keep
an ergonomic hand-written `create` in `sop_catalog.mli`. Marking the
containing module `[@@sop.register]` contributes its local factory to a
deterministic source-order `Sop_catalog.Editor.factories` manifest generated by
the PPX. There is no mutable global initializer and no hand-maintained second
list that can omit an implemented catalog node. Constructors delegate geometry
work to ordinary Procedural/RDK operators; controls are never synthesized from
serialized cache-key strings.

Input metadata is a signature, not merely a port count. Fixed descriptors use
required slots; `[@@sop.node_optional "1,2"]` marks zero-based optional slots
and makes `sop_node` generate an `Edit_graph.factory_slots` descriptor.
`[@@sop.node_slots "input, target"]` names the slots. Generated factories
default to geometry inputs; `[@@sop.node_types "geometry, image"]` declares
mixed nominal inputs in the same order. The factory validates the names,
and the Flow catalog validates them against the type registry. An optional
type atom in a manifest slot preserves the existing untyped slot spelling
for geometry; the checker and graph rows use the declared type.
`sop/attr_from_image` uses this signature for geometry then image, with the
same declaration generating its schema, factory and typed constructor.
`[@@sop.node_types ["fn(vec3,float)->float"; "image"]]` also accepts a list
of serialized types, so commas inside function signatures stay unambiguous.
`[@@sop.node_keywords "field, picture"]` exposes those required physical
inputs as typed Lisp keywords and required labelled OCaml arguments. They
have no scalar Param field, default or drive. A constructor with only keyword
inputs ends in `()`, as a generator does. The manifest retains their physical
input order and keyword names; the catalog validates their Fn/Image types.
Function bodies and captures belong to the language host, which passes an
owned `Procedural.Kernel` bulk runner through the ordinary payload boundary.
Procedural never depends on Flow or Flow_ir.
`sop/iso_surface` is the first bulk field consumer: required `:field` is
`fn(vec3)->float`; `:resolution` defaults to `[64 64 64]` integral cell counts,
`:min`/`:max` to `[-2 -2 -2]`/`[2 2 2]`, `:iso` to zero and `:smooth` to true.
The cook builds `(rx+1)*(ry+1)*(rz+1)` packed XYZ positions, x fastest, with
the extractor's exact lattice arithmetic. The host compiles the field as a
static-count packed map and evaluates exact float64 samples; the shared
`Rdk.Iso_surface.extract_sampled` marcher borrows those samples read-only.
The node is irregular, topology-changing and exact. Constructor validation
rejects fractional/nonpositive resolution, overflowing packed cardinality,
nonfinite/unordered bounds and nonfinite iso; cook errors and cancellation
remain typed. Its generated keyword port and function zone use the ordinary
graph projection and checked argument gestures.
The exact CPU sampler writes a Point float attribute (`:attribute "image"`
by default) from a normalized Point Float2 or Float3 `:uv "uv"` attribute.
`:channel` accepts `"r"`, `"g"`, `"b"`, `"a"`, or `"luminance"` (Rec. 709
weights); red is the default. Sampling is bilinear, clamps both coordinates
to [0,1], and maps v=0 to the first image row. It preserves geometry/topology
and errors on missing/wrong-owner UV, invalid storage or nonfinite values.
It uses `Duplicate_input 0`, Point elementwise facts, reads the UV attribute
and writes the named attribute. The RDK kernel owns sampling and fills
disjoint point ranges through the shared Parallel pool.

Generated factories also carry field views, allowing the canvas to filter Tab results by
compatible value ports. Hand-built factories provide `~fields` to participate
in that typed search.
Disconnected optional references compile as absent operator arguments, while
connecting or disconnecting them rebuilds the physical SOP input list and
retains the document node's identity and parameter values. The generated
rebuild decodes the physical input list with the slot presence captured at
build time, so sparse optional connections keep their slot. Match Size exercises
this path with one required geometry input and one optional target input.

The node menu (`Pxui_graph.Node_menu`: leader `Space a`, `Tab` in the graph panel, or a
right-click on the empty canvas) is a search field over the kinds, the likeliest first.
Typing searches the whole catalog by stable key, display label, or category. Catalog tests require unique keys, instantiate every
registered factory with disconnected placeholders, and compare the constructed
`Node.operation` with the descriptor identity, so a descriptor that cannot
enter an editable graph or points at the wrong SOP fails the test suite. They
also perturb every cook-impact field of every registered node and require its
`Node.parameter_key` to change.
`Pxui_graph.Node_menu.entries_of_factories` is the single adapter from factories to
menu entries, and a reachability regression searches the node menu for every
generated stable key. `Sop.blend_shapes`, `Sop.attribute_composite`, `Sop.skin` and
`Sop.ordered_group` are registered as `sop/blend_shapes`, `sop/attribute_composite`,
`sop/skin` and `sop/ordered_group`; `sketches/ws_morph` uses all four.

Structured immutable parameters use `Parameter.encoded` when a SOP owns an
ordered rule list or nested value. The codec is typed at the descriptor,
validated on every inspector edit, encoded deterministically into node cache
identity, and currently exposed through the ordinary text editor. This keeps
the descriptor stable while a future PXUI multiparm adapter replaces the text
presentation with add/remove/reorderable rows; SOP wrappers never parse UI
state or serialized node cache keys.

Exploded View is a standard registered terminal SOP, not a sketch-local Null or
custom callback. It follows SideFX's public Exploded View piece-attribute and
outward-scale model while retaining Rays's explicit packed render boundary:
its view-impact controls update rigid piece transforms without recooking the
upstream Boolean topology. Geometry materialization remains an explicit later
boundary when a downstream SOP needs the transformed points.

`Procedural.Custom.node` attaches a schema to an existing SOP composition
without recursive reconstruction boilerplate. `Custom.create` and unary
`Custom.map` are the typed OCaml wrangle-like boundary: the callback receives
the immutable parameter record, declared `Context`, and immutable RDK inputs.
`Parameter.key` encodes every current field unambiguously into the session
cache identity, and parameter edits rebuild the callback closure while keeping
the logical graph ID. This is not a VEX interpreter; it is the clean native
extension point for RDK composition, with explicit dependency and
cancellation contracts.

## Editable graph document and sketch environment

`Procedural.Edit_graph` is an immutable network document distinct from a
compiled `Graph.t`. It retains every node, including disconnected nodes and
optional input slots, and validates add/delete/connect/disconnect/atomic-wire-
insert operations. Compilation rebuilds parameterized closures with their
current inputs, rejects cycles and disconnected paths, and produces an ordinary
immutable DAG for the existing deterministic Session cook path.
Bypass is immutable entry metadata: compilation uses only the primary input,
retains packed instances, and produces empty geometry without an input.
Copy/paste retains the flag and its unchanged literal record.
Dissolve reconnects every consumer through the selected chain's primary
inputs. Wire insertion fills the new node's primary slot and leaves any
additional slots disconnected.

The editor's document is workspace text (`Editor_document.Workspace_doc`), not a
hand-edited `Edit_graph`. `Flow_sop.Lower.workspace` lowers each evaluation of a `sop`
graph to one `Flow_sop.Network`: the `Edit_graph` plus the arguments that depend on `t`.
Before each visible-object cook submission, the editor's value
lane forces those arguments and applies the changed ones to a temporary graph without
changing stored literals. Time-dependent networks resolve on each advancing frame;
unchanged effective values retain their graph and cook keys. A `^:bypass` call makes no
node: the evaluator passes its first input through.

`rays.pxui_graph` presents the text as a graph (`Pxui_graph.Scope` over
`Flow_graph.Projection`): a left-to-right layout on a 24-point lattice, straight wires bent
clear of cards, explicit point/chip/card/full levels, zones for loops and functions.
Its gestures and keys are `specification/flow.md` §6 and §7. The canvas never mutates
the document or cooks geometry; it returns typed requests, and
`rays_editor` applies them as checked rewrites of the text, reports validation errors, and retains the prior
successful viewport result until a newly compiled graph finishes cooking.
This clean-room interaction contract follows SideFX's public descriptions
of the [Network Editor](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/panes/network.html)
and [network navigation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/network/navigate.html),
without copying implementation or assets.

`rays.rays_editor` composes a responsive workspace of panels (by default the
view/graph/inspector columns; a workspace's editor graph describes its own), selected-node inspector, `Easy_camera`
render controls, a sketch-owned playback clock, and one bounded latest-request
cook worker. Default column ratios are 45/35/20; gutters keep the sizes the text says
through resize and every panel can collapse. Empty selection puts camera/render
controls in the inspector, while node selection puts generated parameters there.
The previous successful image stays
visible while a new result cooks. Overlay scenes use view-local
coordinates, not full-window coordinates.
`Editor3` is the one editor: `Viewport3` supplies its camera widgets,
navigation, painting, view persistence and mode state.
Reachable `Context.Time`/`Context.Frame`
dependencies trigger external-effect recooks while static graphs remain cached.
Long dynamic cooks finish before the newest clock snapshot is submitted;
parameter edits remain urgent and supersede stale work. `Space p`, `x` and `r`
play or pause, stop, and reset the local clock; `Space g`, `i`, `c` and `h` control graph,
inspector, camera controls, and all UI.

The template/value split and soft-versus-strict behavior are based on the
public [Houdini ParmTemplate contract](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/hou/ParmTemplate.html),
[Houdini numeric strict-range behavior](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/hou/IntParmTemplate.html),
and [Blender's separate hard/soft property bounds](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.props.html#bpy.props.FloatProperty).
PPX attributes are declared
through PPXlib's typed attribute API so misspelled or malformed metadata fails
at the source location rather than being ignored.

## Nodes and cook contract

A graph is an immutable DAG. Shared OCaml values create shared subgraphs. Each
node has a stable ID, human-readable label, operation/version, immutable
parameters, ordered inputs, cook mode, and declared context dependencies.

Cook modes distinguish generators, input duplication, uniquely owned in-place
opportunities, instances, passthroughs, and generic operations. They describe
optimization opportunities; correctness never depends on a compiled/fused
execution path.

An operator receives a self-contained context, typed parameters, immutable
input snapshots, and operation-local scratch. It cannot reach back into a UI
node. Failures carry the node path and preserve the structured RDK cause.
Warnings such as removed degenerates, recomputed normals, and empty selections
are accumulated deterministically rather than printed from worker domains.

Ordinary graphs are acyclic. Feedback, solvers, and time-history state require
an explicit separate iteration contract; an accidental cycle is always an
error.

`Sop.triangulate` and `Sop.reverse` wrap the corresponding packed RDK kernels.
Triangulate accepts an optional named primitive group, passes unselected
polygon/curve primitives through exactly, and rejects a selected curve.
Reverse accepts an optional named
primitive group and either reverses winding or applies a signed cyclic corner
shift (`~operation:Sop.Shift ~shift:offset`, matching the two Lisp fields).
Missing groups become traced node diagnostics; group resolution,
validation, cancellation, normal policy, exact payload remapping, and
parallelism remain owned by RDK rather than being reimplemented by the graph
layer.

`Sop.normals` exposes owner, weighting, cusp, zero-preservation, reversal,
and override-name fields. Its Lisp defaults are Vertex output and Vertex-angle
weighting; Point, Vertex, Primitive and Detail output are available. Normal,
Peak, Bend and Clip select components with the same optional `group_owner`
and `group` fields in Lisp and OCaml, with a blank name selecting the full
input. Bend defaults to a Y capture direction, Z up vector, unit length and
non-continuous twist. Clip defaults to preserving existing group membership.
Its cache identity includes every control, and missing groups become traced
diagnostics before the kernel is called. Procedural does not compute or cache a
second set of normals.

`Sop.measure_curvature` wraps the single packed RDK surface-curvature kernel.
Its stable node identity includes boundary policy, smoothing controls, point
group, and every optional output name. Point-group resolution and structured
manifold diagnostics remain graph-boundary concerns; triangulation, incidence,
metric estimation, smoothing, and output preservation are not reimplemented in
the cook closure. The operation is static and topology-preserving.

`Sop.attribute_laplacian` uses the same RDK-owned surface metric and topology
index as curvature. Its identity contains the point group, weighting,
normalization, source, and output names. The cook closure resolves only the
named point group and delegates numeric storage conversion, manifold checks,
stable polygon triangulation, mixed-area normalization, incidence reduction,
and immutable output replacement to RDK. It is static and topology-preserving;
no matrix or solver state is hidden in the procedural session.

## Context, parameters, and determinism

The target-neutral context contains finite time, frame number, immutable seed,
domain/grain settings, and a cancellation token. Fixed-step sketches supply
their deterministic frame/time facts through `Sketch_support.Bridge.context_of_frame`. Each node
declares exactly which facts affect it. A static box is not invalidated merely
because time advanced.

Constant parameters are ordinary OCaml values. Time/frame expressions, ramps,
easing, remapping, and deterministic noise are opt-in parameter values and mark
their owning nodes with the corresponding dependency. Random operations derive
stable streams from the user seed, stable node identity, and element index.
Domain count and work-stealing order cannot affect geometry or diagnostics.

`Sop.attribute_fade` is the reference frame-dependent attribute node. Its
parameter key contains both ramps, all timing/name controls, and the roles of
its optional second and third graph inputs, while its context projection
contains only `Frame`. Re-cooking the same graph at another wall-time, seed, or
domain count therefore hits the same bounded cache entry; advancing the frame
invalidates it. This makes the node safe inside the explicit previous-snapshot
iteration model without putting mutable feedback inside a SOP cook.

`Sop.poly_cut` is static and encodes the primitive group, owner-specific cut
group, element/strategy/detection variants, threshold field, and closure policy
in canonical cache identity. Group names are resolved only against the cooked
input; RDK owns classification, interpolation, compaction, and ancestry. This
keeps custom iterative curve sketches compositional: a previous snapshot may
feed PolyCut without storing temporal state or mutable fragments in the node.

`Sop.separate_pieces` is also static. Its cache identity contains owner,
integer/text identity field, translation field, normalized-axis input, gap,
and Separate/Move Back mode. RDK computes the reversible per-piece mapping;
the SOP cook owns neither bounding state nor a retained lookup table. This is
particularly useful before per-piece proximity work in an iterative sketch:
separate, query or modify, then move back without introducing graph feedback.

`Sop.edge_equalize` is static as well. Its cache identity includes the input
and output edge-group names, typed initial target policy, iteration ceiling,
and relative tolerance. The graph cook resolves topology-affine selection and
delegates target reduction, selected incidence, projection, convergence, and
normal invalidation to RDK. It retains no iteration buffers in the node or
session, so an iterative sketch may equalize its previous snapshot without
turning the acyclic per-frame SOP graph into a hidden feedback solver.

`Sop.edge_relax` is a static two-input node whose role key distinguishes source
from matching-topology reference. Point/primitive selection, point pins,
individual or scale-independent reference targets, iterations, step size,
shorten-only policy, and tolerance all participate in cache identity. It is a
useful custom-sketch building block: a previous immutable snapshot can be the
source while a stable design shape supplies rest edge lengths, with all
temporary constraint buffers confined to one cook.

`Sop.blend_shapes` is a static multi-input morph node. Input zero remains the
topology and payload owner. The shared declaration has four fixed optional shape
ports and a repeated `shapes` port for unlimited additional targets. The extra
`weights` table has one finite signed weight per row; missing rows use zero.
The `shape_masks` table has three columns: one-based slot index, mask attribute,
and mask source (`first` or `shape`). Blank cells inherit the global mask settings.
Fixed slots keep indices 1–4 when disconnected; connected extras start at 5.
Unused table rows remain available for later connections. Blank global names
disable their optional controls. Tables, patterns and weights are validated at
construction and every field participates in the schema/cache identity. Empty
targets retain the node's own identity and unchanged cooked geometry. The cook builds
integer/text point-ID maps only when requested, allocates every blended plane
once, and applies targets in descriptor order while point ranges execute in
parallel. No delta, ID, mask, or weight plane survives outside the completed
snapshot/session entry, so an iterative sketch can animate weights by building
a new acyclic node without hidden history growth.

`Sop.attribute_composite` is the general static multi-input attribute fold.
Input zero owns topology and unselected payload. Four fixed optional layer
ports retain their independent weights, followed by an optional repeated
`layers` port for unlimited additional inputs. Its `weights` field is an
escaped one-column table of finite signed weights in connected-input order;
missing rows use 1 and unused rows remain available for later connections.
The typed constructor and Lisp share that flat declaration. Independent owner patterns, first-input weight,
Mean/Maximum/Minimum/Over/Under mode, optional alpha name, and explicit `P`
eligibility all participate in the schema-derived node identity. Blank alpha
names disable masking. Patterns and weights are validated at construction;
attribute discovery, packed
planes, alpha distribution, finite/cardinality validation, and normal
invalidation live exclusively in RDK. No intermediate composite or denominator
plane survives outside the completed immutable snapshot/session entry, making
the node safe to rebuild inside an iterative sketch.

`Sop.attribute_mirror` is a static one-input correspondence node. Its graph
value stores owner, method, named groups and mapping field, attribute pattern,
transform policy, text replacement, and optional metadata names. Named groups
are resolved from the current immutable input at cook time; RDK owns the
reflected spatial search, direct-index mapping, packed payload copies, and
atomic validation. Plane point/primitive and explicit point/vertex/primitive
mapping paths write disjoint ranges through the shared pool. No spatial index,
source map, destination bit-plane, or output builder survives outside the
completed snapshot/session entry, so it is safe to reconstruct around
`Sop.snapshot previous` in an iterative sketch.

`Sop.rewire_vertices` is a static one-input topology modifier. The node stores
only typed selection, target owner/name, recursive-chain policy, target-field
deletion, newly-unused-point cleanup, and optional original-point provenance.
Selection names resolve against each immutable input cook. RDK owns target
validation, functional-graph resolution, corner rewiring, point payload/group
compaction, normal invalidation, and native-edge ancestry. Temporary target,
state, stack, incidence, and compaction planes become unreachable after the
new snapshot is committed, so iterative sketches can author changing
connectivity without hidden mutable graph state.

`Sop.edge_transport`, `Sop.edge_transport_curves`, and
`Sop.edge_transport_parent` are static attribute-flow nodes over the same
immutable RDK snapshot. The network node resolves point and explicit-root
groups at cook time, the curve node resolves a primitive group and schedules
independent curves by stable primitive ranges, and the parent node resolves an
integer point-parent field plus an optional point group. Network and Parent
support forward copy/split and backward Add/Maximum/Minimum branch merging.
None retains a parent forest, distance plane, child index, or normalization
table in the graph cache beyond the completed geometry. Iterative sketches may
therefore transport a field from the previous `Sop.snapshot` without hidden
feedback or unbounded per-frame state.

## Sessions and caching

Mutable evaluation state belongs to an explicit `Session.t`, never a global
graph. Its cache has both an entry limit and a retained-byte budget. The key is
the operator/version, canonical parameters, the schema-derived parameter key
of a parameterized node, input identities, declared context facts, and
explicit external-resource fingerprints. It is an opaque, length-prefixed
binary string built without `Printf` on the per-node cook path. Whole geometry
buffers are not rehashed on every frame.

`Node.facts` owns the cook mode, element-wise class, attribute reads/writes,
topology preservation and exactness. The optional `[@@sop.node_facts
{elementwise; reads; writes; topology; exact}]` type attribute refines the
conservative declaration and can refer to `parameters`; generated rebuilds
refresh it after parameter changes. Unannotated nodes read/write `"*"`, are
irregular, topology-changing and exact. The default declaration is exposed by
the factory and included in the generated Lisp manifest; `Flow.Check` carries
its domain-neutral kernel metadata.

`sop/noise_displace` declares two modes in its parameter schema. The default
`height_2d` reads P and adds signed X/Z noise to Y. `normal_3d` reads P and
point N and computes `P + N * (amplitude * Noise.sample3(P * frequency))`,
without normalizing N. At seed 0 this is the Flow `noise3` kernel's formula.
Both modes preserve topology and invalidate point/vertex N; changing mode
rebuilds the declared reads. Missing/wrong-storage point N, non-finite results
and cancellation return typed RDK errors.

A single-input `Duplicate_input 0` or `Passthrough 0` node with preserved
topology and explicit reads/writes uses topology, group and edge-group IDs,
the input attribute owner/name order, and IDs only for the payloads it reads.
Canonical positions are `"P"`; other names select every matching owner.
Changing an unread color payload can therefore reuse a normal or transform
computation. Attribute addition/removal/reordering conservatively recooks.
On reuse, the session combines the cached computed payloads with fresh untouched
input attributes, preserves output ordering and refreshes inherited diagnostics.
The result keeps its identity on subsequent unchanged hits. A node that replaces
declared preserved topology, changes groups, writes an undeclared payload or
returns packed instances fails with traced `E_NODE_FACTS`; no invalid entry is
published. Ordinary opaque nodes retain whole-snapshot keys.

Unchanged cache hits return the same immutable snapshot. Results are inserted only after
a complete successful cook; cancellation cannot publish partial geometry.
Eviction drops strong references, `Session.clear` releases all entries, and
`Session.close` provides prompt lifetime control. Session statistics expose
cooks, hits, misses, evictions, retained bytes, and last-node timings.

Independent branches may cook in parallel only when measured work justifies
it. Fine-grained RDK kernel parallelism is the default. Nested evaluation shares
Rays's one process-wide pool and must not oversubscribe it.

Interactive sketches submit expensive graphs through `Async_cook`, never by
calling `Session.cook` from the application update callback. One persistent
coordinator domain owns one single-caller session and a one-slot latest-request
queue. Submitting a newer graph atomically cancels the active context, replaces
the pending graph, and invalidates any unpublished completion. Stale or partial
geometry can therefore never replace the displayed snapshot. `poll` transfers
only an immutable prepared value back to the sketch; SDL, renderer, texture,
and GPU operations remain on the initial domain.

The preparation callback may perform target-neutral validation, shard or
component classification, attribute extraction, and packed render-mesh
construction. It must retain and check the request context's cancellation
token in long loops. Keep the prior successful mesh visible while `status`
reports elapsed cook time. Use a foreground `Sketch` domain count of one and
reserve one hardware domain from the background cook context; the persistent
coordinator releases its domain-owned cached Domainslib pools before exit.
`Async_cook.close` cancels work, joins the coordinator, closes its session, and
belongs in `Sketch.run_state ~on_stop`.

## Selection, attributes, and inspection

The approachable API uses typed, composable selections rather than beginning
with a group-expression language. Named groups can capture a selection for
reuse. Standard typed helpers cover `P`, `N`, `Cd`, `uv`, `v`, `id`, `pscale`,
`scale`, `orient`, and `up`; arbitrary attributes retain explicit owner and
storage types.

Inspection is part of the first release, not debug-only infrastructure:

- graph inspection reports node labels, operations, inputs, parameters, and
  time dependencies;
- cooked inspection reports element counts, memory estimate, attributes,
  groups, cache state, duration, domains, and grain;
- DOT export makes sharing and pipeline structure visible;
- errors identify graph path, input number, actual and expected geometry, and
  a likely corrective operation where possible.

  modes;
  typed topology editing: point/vertex/primitive Delete with destroy/heal and
  selected/non-selected policies, named-group Blast, and cache-sharing
  selected/remainder Split branches;
- topology groups: native topology-affine Edge Group with primitive,
  incidence, length, face-dihedral, and pairwise incident-edge angle filters;
  named edge groups remain
  distinct from side-specific outgoing-corner vertex groups; Group from
  Attribute Boundary finds typed point/vertex/primitive discontinuities and
  emits native-edge, point, or primitive selections with tuple tolerance and
  unshared-curve policy; Groups from Name creates stable, explicitly bounded
  point or primitive groups from non-empty text values with replace/union and
  ignore/force-valid naming policy, while Name from Groups converts selected

  overlap and source-deletion policy; Group Random provides context-seeded or
  explicitly seeded point/vertex/primitive/native-edge chance selection with
  base restriction and packed merge algebra; Group Bounds provides inclusive

  Boundary Components emits stable, bounded point groups for each connected
  polygon-surface boundary; Group Promotions
  converts among every point/vertex/primitive/native-edge owner using touching,
  complete-containment, or shared-edge rules and can emit an ordinary-owner
  integer mask instead of a group. Ordered rules compile wildcard
  selection/capture rewrites, safely snapshot same-rule sources, allow later
  rules to re-promote earlier outputs, and bound output count/payload; Group
  Promote Boundary retains only the
  converted selection frontier and can union typed attribute seams, controlled
  polygon/curve unshared edges, and point-sharing primitive boundaries, while
  Group Expand performs
  signed topology steps or a connected-component flood over every owner and can
  materialize the first-change/BFS distance as an integer attribute. Point and
  edge-connected primitive growth can additionally stop at an adjacent normal
  spread, typed point/vertex/primitive attribute discontinuities, or an
  independently owned collision boundary; collision membership can contain
  growth and boundary elements can be retained or excluded. Attribute and
  collision seams also define shrink-away boundaries; Group
  Range supplies absolute/relative/partition ranges and periodic filters,
  optionally evaluated independently over stable disconnected point or
  primitive regions with a one-region restriction,
  Group Combine and Invert provide four-owner packed boolean algebra, Group
  Delete/Rename provide ordered wildcard metadata rules, and two-input Group
  Copy maps membership by indices, primitive-local corners, or integer/text
  attributes; two-input Group Transfer maps point, primitive, and native-edge
  membership by accelerated exact geometric proximity and preserves ordinary
  source-group order using source sequence, proximity, and stable index ties;

  primitive-dual paths through contiguous ordered bases or start/end pairs,
  with stop/close endings, same-owner shared-element avoidance and collision
  exclusion/containment, and parallel independent routes;

  float/int values, grouped Vec3 values and four quaternion channels take the
  same optional defaults in Lisp and OCaml, with finite values checked at construction;
  constant point transform matrices take 16 optional scalar entries, validated
  as finite and affine; constant color takes a grouped Vec3 plus alpha;
  Rest Position stores/extracts/swaps positions and optional normals, with a
  positional optional reference input; Enumerate separates integer/text storage
  from the text prefix;
  Attribute Blur and Smooth take a mode plus separate Laplacian/custom step
  sizes, with pattern/finite checks at construction. Smooth defaults to 10
  iterations without normal recomputation. Attribute promotion keeps sources
  by default. PolyFrame takes separate style/attribute and selection fields;
  blank tangent/bitangent names disable those outputs;

  reference-name prepend and keep mode, ordered capture-pattern Attribute
  Rename with skip/error/overwrite conflicts, ordered owner-specific Attribute

  last-match precedence; deterministic contributing-source indices for scalar
  reductions and fixed-width float2/3/4 component-source CSR rows; documented

  plus packed scalar integer/float Array of All and sorted Unique Values CSR
  output with complete piece-row remapping; direct
  ordered/cyclic Attribute Copy with
  integer/text value or explicit-element matching, owner-independent topology
  projection, wildcard renaming, and structural sharing for identity plans;
  fused multi-input Attribute Combine across all numeric RDK storage with seven
  arithmetic modes, preprocessing, tuple conversion, per-element blending,

  and exact or compiled-pattern
  owner-matched groups and shared full-strength/blend-band controls,
  closest-polygon vertex transfer, structurally shared detail transfer, and
  explicit mixed-owner polygon-surface sampling into target points, vertices,
  or primitive barycenters with optional distance output; primitive and
  vertex source groups can intersect the sampled surface, with explicit

  `attribute_transfer_all` node can cook explicit point/vertex/primitive/detail
  patterns while sharing each owner's query plan and committing metadata once; native

The undocumented Blinn/Wyvill/Elendt transfer kernels and multi-sample vertex

groups intentionally have no attribute owner), and parallel component
labeling, remaining
distance kernels,
packed-instance attribute-driven transforms, multiple packed prototypes and
packed piece matching, per-instance payloads, Boolean resolved output mode
and source restriction/naming controls (the public exact
`Sop.boolean` already exposes solid/surface products, per-input
self-intersection resolution, full primitive/point/vertex payload and group
transfer, exact native-edge ancestry, point conflict promotion, seam-point
splitting, named solid Shatter pieces, bounded strict/diagnostic tiny-seam
cleanup, safe source-polygon detriangulation, and closed rounding
verification. Interpolated point/vertex `N` is normalized and follows exact
extraction ancestry: a reversed output facet negates its source normal so the
payload remains aligned with output winding. `Sop.boolean_fracture`
additionally emits a dense primitive
piece identity from exact oriented Weiler cells for solid-by-surface fracture;
shared seam topology is retained and packing uses the identity rather than
polygon connectivity. Terminal packed-piece rendering expands triangle
vertices without discarding those authored normals. `Sop.boolean_seam`
exposes named left-self, between-input,
right-self, and coincident-patch products), and the remaining
documented Remesh adaptive/group/boundary controls,
volumes, the remaining Boolean Fracture naming/interior-group/constraint modes,
native edge-group seam heuristics,
SCP/ABF flattening constraints, UV unwrap/layout, and a convenience iterative sketch-feedback
wrapper remain later work. A public placeholder is
not used for an operation that lacks a real result contract.

## Iterative creative sketches

Iterative creative sketches keep feedback outside the per-frame DAG. A
`Sketch.run_state` model owns the previous `Rdk.Geometry.t`; each fixed-timestep
update wraps it with `Sop.snapshot`, composes ordinary SOPs or `Sop.custom`
RDK work, cooks the next immutable value, and replaces the previous one.
The graph for each step remains acyclic and independently inspectable.

Only current/next snapshots are application-live by default. The associated
`Session.t` must have explicit entry and payload-byte limits, so prior cook and
mesh results age out predictably; optional history/checkpoints need a separate
bounded ring. Pure heavy kernels still use the reusable domain pool, then join
before mesh conversion and rendering. Render-only repetition should remain an
`Instances.t` transform payload rather than being fed back as multiplied
topology. This is enough for erosion-like iteration, growth, relaxation,
agent-written trails, reaction fields converted to geometry, and similar
creative feedback without claiming a rigging, dynamics, or VFX solver suite.

Point Jitter makes the minimal random-walk form concrete: each fixed update
wraps the prior snapshot, applies `Sop.point_jitter ~seed:step_seed`, cooks the
new snapshot, and stores only that result. Use an integer ID attribute when
topology edits may renumber points, and derive `step_seed` from the immutable
sketch seed and step number. A point mask or `pscale` can carry persistent
per-point influence without allocating a history plane. The same pattern can
replace Point Jitter with a composed SOP operation or a typed RDK custom
kernel; feedback ownership and memory bounds do not change.

Rest and motion data use the same explicit boundary. `Sop.rest_position`
stores, extracts, or swaps packed reference positions and optional point
normals; a second input can supply the reference snapshot without copying its
numeric planes. `Sop.point_velocity` accepts explicit previous and/or next
snapshot inputs for backward, forward, or central finite differences. Integer
or text IDs preserve correspondence across deterministic topology edits,
central mode can emit acceleration, and a point group restricts writes while
preserving existing values elsewhere. There is no implicit time-shift cook or
retained previous-frame node state: the sketch model owns those snapshots.

A reusable custom procedural node is therefore an ordinary function from
immutable parameters and input `Node.t` values to `Node.t`. Its implementation
composes public SOPs when possible and uses `Sop.custom` only for a missing
RDK kernel, with an explicit operation/version/parameter key. A sketch
solver may run one iteration per frame or several iterations until a measured
time/work budget is exhausted, but deterministic/export runs use an explicit
iteration count rather than a wall-clock cutoff. It commits only a complete
next snapshot.
It never exposes a half-mutated geometry if cancellation or a deadline fires.
This keeps realtime iteration memory proportional to current/next geometry,
bounded session state, and explicitly bounded optional history.

The OCaml API is intentionally smaller and strongly typed. It adopts documented
workflow concepts without copying Houdini source or wire formats.

## Packed outputs

A cook result may be packed: `Session.output.instances = Some transforms`
means "draw `geometry` once per transform". Copy to Points with **Pack and
instance** produces one (the source once, `Rdk.Instance_copy.copy_transforms`
of the targets: the same pscale/scale/orient/N/up/rot/trans/pivot/transform
rules as the unpacked copy). Packed instances stay outside `Rdk.Geometry.t`:
a node that consumes a packed result receives it materialized (the explicit
boundary), memoized per packed output so downstream cache keys keep hitting.
Renderers draw packed results as instances (`Scene3.instances_array`, the
path tracer's instance structures), so editing target attributes re-uploads
transforms, never multiplied topology.

Switch selection is the integer `:input` parameter. Its inspector presents
input-dependent branch labels, while the parameter value, drive type and cook
key retain the integer index when those labels change.

Transform uses one declaration for TRS and Matrix modes. TRS remains the Lisp
default; orders, shear, pivot, inversion and group selection are editable fields.
Matrix mode exposes all sixteen matrix coefficients, with identity defaults.
Both typed Transform entry points share this declaration and its defaults.

Attribute Noise derives its typed arguments from its Lisp fields. Explicit
seed zero is the default; context-seed mode retains its stable label stream
and declares the Seed dependency. Sampling and range choices use flat enums,
with grouped Vec3 bounds plus separate fourth components for quaternion ranges.

Attribute Randomize's custom ramp, weighted numeric and weighted text
distributions are Lisp choices. Ramps use comma-separated position:value knots;
weighted tables use escaped tab-separated columns and newline-separated rows.
Explicit selections use owner/name fields alongside the owner-matched group
shorthand, and per-component limits supplement the existing scalar limits.
Fraction sampling ignores seed controls, matching the Lisp factory.

Attribute Interpolate shares Lisp's flat driver fields and defaults. Attribute
rules are an escaped owner/source/target table; blank rules allow pattern-only
transfer. Group patterns take precedence over exact names. Explicit weight
drivers require a positive threshold, and computed arrays require the
primitive/UVW driver with point or vertex numbers. Invalid controls fail at
construction and inspector edits return the validation error.

Attribute Transfer uses flat sampling and falloff controls with positional
source/target inputs. `use_names` selects an escaped one-column name table;
otherwise the existing attribute pattern applies. Explicit distance remains
the Lisp default, while Auto enables unbounded transfer and detail ownership.
Group patterns take precedence over exact names. Source vertex groups retain
their all/any triangle-corner selection controls.
